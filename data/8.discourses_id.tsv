d1	The fact that there's a lunar eclipse that day heightens that need. Indeed, it could be that your focus in the next fortnight (until the solar eclipse on 22nd) will be very strong indeed. True, this could be triggered by unexpected events on Monday which underline the need for change. And true, you've had several sidewinders thrust your way in recent years - and these haven't left you racing for more education. Now though, you may want to [...]
d2	This is a book of great depth that manages to combine a modern mystery with two completely different dimensions - one historical and one spiritual. Writing a good mystery is an art in itself. I've reviewed a lot of them and it takes a really good writer to make me care about the characters as people and to feel involved in their lives and their tribulations. Usually I read them in a detached way, assessing the characterization, setting, dialogue and so on. This [...]
d3	"We defend any conference which entails coordination, unanimity and consultation over security and stability in the region,"" he said as foreign ministers of Iran, Turkey, Syria, Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia prepared to meet in Is tanbul ahead of another meeting of the same countries' heads of state. We hope that we would reach a common ground on regional security, not only restricted to Iraq, during the summit co nference which will be held after the foreign ministers' meeting in order to prove that regional issues have to be resolved by their people without need of outside interference,"" Khatami said. Turkey has invited the six countries to take part in the conference, aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the Ir aqi crisis amid US threats to oust Saddam Hussein. Article Index China Worried about Military Concentration in Gulf Area China is worried about the military concentra tion in the Gulf area, hoping that the Iraq issue be resolved through diplomatic and political means within the fra mework of the United Nations. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue [...]"
d4	Hi lot's of people ask me about weight loss . I want to answer once for everyone In the context of physical health, weight loss is the process of losing body weight, typically by losing fat. To achieve weight loss, more calories must be expended than taken in. This can be achieved by reducing the amount of food consumed, increasing physical activity or a combination of the two. For healthy weight loss, most experts recommend a combination of healthy eating patterns and regular physical exercise. Other methods of losing weight include use of prescribed or herbal drugs or chemicals that [...]
d5	"What is more, they have retained their emotional, cultural and spiritual links with the country of their origin. This strikes a reciprocal chord in the hearts of people of India. Also, any longed-for return to the homeland now tends to be downplayed in favor of ideological identification or transnational practice that can link the scattered community with the homeland. Today, self-defined diasporas tend to find esteem - and a kind of strength-in-numbers - through using the term. This shift in the adoption and meaning of ""diaspora"" has undoubtedly caused some confusion and [...] "
d6	There is no end of it, the voiceless wailing, no end to the withering of withered flowers, to the movement of pain that is painless and motionless, to the drift of the sea and the drifting wreckage, the bone's prayer to Death its God. Only the hardly, barely prayable Prayer of the one Annunciation. It seems, as one becomes older, that the past has another pattern, and ceases to be a mere sequence- or even development: the latter a partial fallacy encouraged by superficial notions of evolution, which becomes, in the popular mind, a means of [...]
d7	Shifty's New Leaflet Shifty's is still able to offer workshops in Alcohol Awareness. They have a fun approach to learning and will tailor a session to the age and needs of the young people you are working with. Dawn and Andy have designed a new leaflet, which should have been sent out with Chatterbox to all schools, colleges and youth groups to remind everyone that the alcohol awareness workshops are still available. The project has been funded for a further period by The Big Lottery and we are keen to see lots of young people taking part and understanding the dangers that [...]
d8	Learning outcomes On completion of the course, you will have acquired appropriate practical skills and have a highly developed understanding of their application within your field. You will be able to create and sustain complex arts projects, informed by knowledge of developments at the forefront of your discipline, and develop and maintain arts projects with a high level of understanding of your own processes. You will be able to effectively manage and challenge the limits of your own learning. In addition you will have the ability to apply the methods and techniques that you have learned to review, consolidate, extend and apply your knowledge and understanding, and to initiate and carry out projects. You will also critically evaluate arguments, assumptions, abstract concepts and data (that may be incomplete), to make judgements, and to [...]
d9	A week later, loyalist paramilitaries shot dead seven people in a mainly Catholic pub close to the Waterside area of Derry/Londonderry. On the political front uncertainty reigned. Talks between the constitutional political parties in the province had broken down and the response of the republican and loyalist paramilitaries, and their associated political parties, to the Downing Street Declaration was not yet known when the fieldwork ended. The IRA and loyalist ceasefires were not, in fact, called until 31 August and 13 October 1994 respectively. These ceasefires [...]
d10	To the extent that such arguments have helped to temper the immediate American response and provide a rather different agenda for the 'war on terrorism', Blair should be credited for his efforts, not dismissed as Bush's poodle. Furthermore, on one level at least, the general argument for the construction of a meaningful global community that could establish new ways of working leading to the betterment of life for all is one that can hardly be faulted. While it may not preclude military action, neither does it look entirely incompatible with the slogan 'Justice not Vengeance'. But we should not forget that this was the architect of New Labour talking and New Labour is a particular configuration within European social democracy, which itself has been drastically 'modernised' over the last twenty years or so. What are the implications of this for [...]
d11	Aside from the campaign, there are loads of challenges to unlock and try to set high scores in - in fact this game reminds me a lot of the classic Goldeneye; you'll definitely find yourself going back to old missions and finding speedier routes to complete the mission in a set amount of time (which gives you yet another reward), using a certain amount of hotswaps (another reward), dying as little as you can (yep, another), and exceeding the accuracy standard (you guessed it!) If you enjoy the campaign - and if you are a fan of the FPS shooter genre - then I don't see how you could appreciate the genuine replay value; there's just so much to unlock and achieve, including a high rank similar to the one that you can achieve online. Battlefield 2: Modern Combat is simply a phenomenal experience, online and off, that should be played by any FPS fan, or just action game fans in general. If you're bored of the genre then this is the game you've been waiting for, as it [...]
d12	Much of the literature on unmediated, and therefore less 'expert' access to iconographical research collections assumes that searchers will have a hierarchy of more or less abstract 'keywords' for what they expect the image to contain. The analysis of the subject of images is, for most authors, based ultimately on Panofsky's pre-iconography/iconography/iconology schema or on Karen Markey's work on access to specialist picture collections, which draws upon it. The pessimistic conclusion of most researchers looking at this problem is that the burden of access will fall more heavily on the users, given the variability of subject cataloguing amongst diverse collections. For our purposes the principal weakness of these user studies is that they are of mediated searches, that it written or recollected queries given to an information manager. How, we must ask, do the image users themselves, the art historians, typically [...]
d13	This is probably not a name a lot of people will be familiar with, and I certainly was not when I first came across this album. First a few background details; as far as I can tell, the band are of French origin, though from what I can gather they are a collection of musicians from other bands, which I must confess I have not previously heard of - Kad and Tayfa. Interestingly, the lyrics are sung in the rather obscure French Breton dialect. This album is a concept, telling the story of a female stonecutter called Enora - who is able to [...]
d14	The Missouri River road brought Lewis and Clark (and Sacajawea) here; between July 16, 1805 and July 24 to be exact; their Journal entries tell us what they saw, what they did, and how they felt about it all. Lewis writes that they killed a buffalo near the river on July 16, and dined on it for breakfast. On the 17th he notes the sunflowers blooming abundantly in the river bottom. The next day he writes of his eagerness to meet up with the Shoshone as he hopes to get information from them. But it's the entry of July 19 that [...]
d15	This seminar will present the aims and methods of this major research network funded by the ESRC. The network is based around three research projects at the University of Leeds, the University of York, King's College London and the University of Southampton. Work has commenced this year and will continue to 2003. The major aim of the research network is to improve the interface between science education researchers and practitioners, particularly teachers, by developing and evaluating several examples of evidence-based practice, and by improving our understanding of the ways in which practitioners draw upon evidence in taking actions and making decisions. The first stage of project 3, a Delphi study exploring what should be taught about the nature of science, conducted at King's and Southampton has been completed and the [...]
d16	Can it use new and developing technologies to better effect? How can Parliament engage people at a local level? Is visiting Parliament a useful means to learn more about events that take place there? And how can Parliament better inform the public and young people about what it does? The following [...]
d17	The Royal Sovereign was thought to have sunk in the Mediterranean and the engine salvaged. The Lancaster's, the owners of the colliery, built Bestwood Colliery Village in 1876. The houses were some of the best in the East Midlands. A small front garden was complemented by a walled back garden. The Village [...]
d18	A recent UK government committee on the ethics of gene therapy concluded that germ line therapy was ethically unacceptable, but that somatic gene therapy could go ahead. The world's first somatic gene therapy trial in humans was carried out in 1990 on two young girls suffering from ADA deficiency, a very rare fatal genetic defect which meant they had virtually no immunity against infection. Today they are able to lead normal lives. There are now over 30 different clinical trials of gene therapy in the US, and the first trial in the UK was started earlier this year. In a recent national TV programme in the US, doctors [...]
d19	He offers a wager and they accept his challenge. The women are led to believe that the men have been called away on military service. It is, however, a test of the women's fidelity since the men reappear in disguise and proceed to woo the sisters. The women finally succumb to their advances, deciding, however, to swap fiances. The men are distraught but Don Alfonso [...]
d20	Constitutional Council bill passed The Assembly of the Republic on 21 October passed the second reading of an amended bill setting up a Constitutional Council. This is the body empowered to decide whether legislative and statutory acts of state bodies are in accordance with the constitution, to settle conflicts of competence between sovereign state bodies, and to supervise elections. It is the Constitutional Council that must take the final decisions on electoral complaints, and validate election results. The Constitutional Council will eventually have seven members - five elected by the Assembly, one appointed by the President of the Republic, and a seventh member chosen by the other six. All must possess law degrees, and [...]
d21	Authority's remedy, if you spent too much time out of the stream in one year, was to keep you back a class. But this would mean ructions in the family, whose shaky economic viability depended on your starting work the day after your 14th birthday. Socially too, the stigma of having attended school into your 15th year could follow you to the grave ('Thick as champ when he was wee'). But even being cast up in an isolation ward in Purdysburn Fever for three weeks could provide some items of 'experience and knowledge', the accumulation of which the O.E.D. quotes as essential to the acquisition of Wisdom. For instance, I would never again be able to visit a zoo without being physically sick, [...]
d22	Yes, unrestricted submarine warfare by the German Navy would be scrupulously examined. No, the obliteration of German cities by the Allied air forces was not relevant. 'Crimes against Humanity' would be treated in the same way. The mass killing of subject races by the Germans would come under the microscope, but not the Katyn massacre or the dropping of the Atomic Bomb on Japan. But you would be wrong if you thought that the obvious double-standards of the original trials [...]
d23	Extremely powerful high-temperature detergents clean fuel injectors. Lubricants significantly lengthen injector and pump life and reduce ring friction which is very important for today's low-sulfur fuel. Both Red Line Diesel Fuel Catalyst and 85 Plus are available as a winterized version which will reduce the pour point of a typical fuel by 25F. Diesel Fuel Catalyst Contains powerful high temperature detergents, lubricants and a combustion catalyst. This catalyst reduces smoke dramatically, reduces detonation, and [...]
d24	"Each year I attend a musical production put on by Bedford Modern School, I come away saying ""They will never beat this one!  - and each year I am proved wrong! This year it was ""My Fair Lady"" and it was a triumph! Nick Brooks, as Professor Higgins, and Matt Burt, as Colonel Pickering, were superb in their roles, both quite demanding ones, as they are on stage for much of the two and a half hour production. Elie Middleton, as Eliza Doolittle excelled, as did Doug Penman as Alfred Doolittle. How Helen Rees-Bidder (director) and John Mower (Musical director) manage to [...]"
d25	"Businesses that support upward mobility for selected managerial women while relying on a disempowered female workforce may earn praise from liberal feminists, but they do little to satisfy more radical feminist critiques. The feminism I speak from is more radical because it finds the existing power structures unacceptable no matter who is at the helm. It is informed primarily by two competing impulses: one to create a ""woman centered"" understanding of the world and a contrary one to deconstruct the distinction between margin and center. The relation between the two is complex, full of tension and opportunity. Both impulses [...]"
d26	Through the programme students gain a critical awareness of current scholarship in selected fields of comparative theatrical theory and performance history, as well as a comprehensive understanding of the techniques and methods required to pursue independent research in the discipline. By the time they complete the MA, students have thorough knowledge of their chosen specialist field of research in theatre history and/or performance theory, and the critical and evaluative skills to define an individual path of further research. Students work one-to-one with their supervisor, and in small research groups. The programme develops high-level skills in research methodologies, including using bibliographical, archive and research resources. Individual guidance allows students to [...]
d27	This Bootle character does not seem to realise that Japan will never recover (irrespective of the exchange rate) until it introduces structural reform! It is Japans domestic economy that is the problem - not the export element. In particular, Japan needs to sort out its banking crisis. Reform of the banking system would cause considerable short-term pain, as a result of job losses from consolidations and closures. However, it is the only way for Japan to [...]
d28	This sector is more likely to address packaging change than any other industry, which is to be expected in light of the EC's Directive on Packaging. The White Paper 'This Common Inheritance' has set a target to divert 50 per cent of recyclable household waste away from landfill by the year 2000; at the moment just 14 per cent is recycled. A total of 65 per cent of companies have made some changes to minimise the use of packaging, and of those who produce paper and card, 90 per cent recycle it. However, if the food and retailing industry is to meet government targets for recycling, it needs to find markets for this material. These potential markets are supplied by France and Germany which [...]
d29	At this moment a young man addressed me, and announcing himself as the son of Mrs. Audley, the lady with whom I was henceforth to live, led me to the boat which waited at the side of the vessel; and a short journey brought us to Clifton and the cottage where Mrs. Audley resided. How vividly the thoughts and feeling which crowded that night about my pillow rise upon my memory! I think it is not saying too much of that natural instinct which attracts us to one person and repels us from another, when I call it infallible. There is truth and certainty in our first impressions; we are so much the creatures of habit, so much governed in our opinions by the opinions of others, we so rarely begin to think till our thoughts are already biassed, that our intuitive perception of good and evil, and consequently of friend and foe, is utterly neglected. If, in forming our attachments, instead of repeating what we have heard, we [...]
d30	David Harcourt took out the patent in 1835 for the first automatic press and almost a hundred years later the same machine was still in use in the family's manufactory. Until the nineteenth century casting was the usual method used by brassfounders, which involved pouring molten copper alloys into moulds. Braziers, a separate trade, wrought goods by hand from sheet brass. Both had their own guilds or companies established in 14th century London. Birmingham was not a guild town, and, therefore [...]
d31	Dr Ken Dark is an archaeologist and a Lecturer in Politics at the University of Reading Photography, [...] Now here's an odd thing. Photographic books about ancient sites and monuments are rare enough, and here are two arriving at once, with almost the same title, covering much the same ground. Many of the same sites appear in both books. Both, however, are welcome. A fine photograph has unparallelled power to [...]
d32	It is true indeed that not a sparrow drops unnoticed by the Mind of THE ALL - that even the hairs on our head are numbered, as the scriptures have said. There is nothing outside of Law; nothing that happens contrary to it. And yet, do not make the mistake of supposing that man is but a blind automaton - far from that. The Hermetic Teachings are that man may use Law to overcome laws, and that the higher will always prevail against the lower, until at last he has reached the stage in which he seeks refuge in the LAW itself, and laughs the phenomenal laws to scorn. Are you able to [...]
d33	Cricket officials are also hoping that once the game takes firm roots in China, they can push cricket's case for inclusion in the Olympic Games. Half of the ¬£200,000 comes from the ACC development fund and the rest by the ICC's use of a special fund. ICC CEO Malcolm Speed, now on a tour of the country along with Huq, stressed that people should not expect instant results in China. There's been a very good start in China. This is a 10-year project and no one should be under any illusion that [...]
d34	These groups of people may have a diet that is not meeting their nutritional requirements and may benefit from vitamin supplements: Elderly people, particularly those who live on their own, may find it harder to make healthy meals, and may wish to top up their vitamin intake with a multivitamin supplement. Older people who don't get much sun because they are housebound or covered up for most of the year are advised to take a supplement that includes ten micrograms of vitamin D each day. Vegetarians and vegans - consider taking vitamin supplements to replace those that are found in meat and dairy products, particularly if it's not possible to substitute meat with high-protein foods such as pulses and beans. People who are chronically ill. People who [...]
d35	Examinations and certification There is no compulsory examination at the end of primary education nor, in most Länder, at the end of compulsory, full-time lower secondary education. However, there are leaving certificates from some types of lower secondary school, which grant access to certain types of upper secondary education. The main academic qualification on completion of upper secondary education is the Abitur, which allows successful students to progress to higher education. Successful completion of many of the vocational courses offered in full-time vocational schools at upper secondary level either enables students to enter higher education or to [...]
d36	A scale model of a room and a normal size DML were used to carry out physical measurements. The results support the case that DML and conventional cone loudspeakers excite the modal sound field differently. Predictions were obtained using analytical models that represent the acoustic response of rectangular rooms to different source parameters and positioning. As a part of this work some analytical solutions have been suggested for the issue of distributed sources in rooms, more specifically for plates with simply supported boundaries. Figure 2: Bruno Fazenda at his computer. At a later stage, digital signal processing is used to create virtual rooms in order to study the subjective perception of various [...]
d37	The precise parameters of this right will unfold as further cases are brought. This could become an issue in relation to admission and exclusion decisions. It is likely, but not certain, that the requirement of Article 6, that bodies deciding matters of civil rights should provide a fair trial of the issue, applies to student disciplinary hearings. This requirement raises questions as to how far internal hearings should be public and the extent to which the decision-maker should be independent of the institution. The European Court of Human Rights cases show that where a person's right to [...]
d38	Why is Saddam Hussein pushing ahead with weapons of mass destruction if at some point he is not going to use them? It's certainly got to be a factor in all of this. Unlike anthrax, the bacteria used in last year's unsolved mail attacks, the highly contagious smallpox virus can be passed from person to person. The virus causes ugly pustules to form both on the skin and inside the mouth and throat. About a third of unvaccinated people who [...]
d39	In fact I pay the high prices to save a drunk thug causing a fight for the hell of it. mark from huddersfield : people are never happy. If new places opened and charged ¬£4 a pint no one would go and there whould probably be a message board on over priced drinks. People know there limits just because asda are selling beans at 6p instead of 36p people dont go home and eat six cans. Make the most of it. Nothing lasts for ever. Wayne from Marsden now : I also think this is a non-issue. Students are uprooted, and have to make friends - how many casual conversations have been struck up in a Starbucks etc. If people want to [...]
d40	We are not 100% sure if he was a tyrant technically, perhaps he was a chief or governor which may have got him off the hook. He is acquitted. The most likely explanation is because of his story about trying to trick the Persians in Scythia. It is possible that this story is not true, as who could have witnessed the events of the Scythian campaign in Athens apart from Miltiades? So the Athenians [...]
d41	That may well be a time of doubt and questioning; but that doubt and questioning can be a very creative process. It may also be for us (as it must have been for John) a time of physical and mental suffering; but remember - our Lord meets us supremely on the cross when all is darkest and most difficult; and that is when we often find we know him most powerfully present with us - Listen to another prisoner. Lt Gerald Coffee was imprisoned by the Vietnamese for 7 years: During his second Christmas in that rotten hellhole of a camp he made an amazing discovery. He had been stripped of everything by which he measured his identity: rank , uniform, family, money. And yet, alone in a cramped three by seven foot cell, he began to [...]
d42	"The bassist and the banjoist then likened the ""call"" to a chorus or middle eight in a standard jazz structure (i.e. in a 24 bar standard - ABA - or a 32 bar standard - AABA - A is an 8 bar chorus and B is the middle eight, introducing a different melody). The tutor said this was not so, and again attempted to explain the ""call"". At this point the bassist accepted the explanation, but the banjoist continued to categorise it as a chorus, persistently attempting to fit this unfamiliar feature into an already known pattern. I had already come across it in African music and dance, where the lead drummer plays a similar repeated rhythmic phrase to signal a change of rhythm to the musicians and a change of step to the dancers. I therefore broke into the argument and attempted an explanation in these terms and one or two of the rest of the group made comments, so that the argument petered out and the tension was temporarily diffused, although the banjoist continued to [...]"
d43	Like in paragraph rules, long-short patterns are also effective in lines and stanzas. You may follow a long phrase with a fragment. Play with the dots. But use them reasonably. Punctuate to emphasize and to show. Ellipses, for example, can heighten and prolong emotions by giving the reader pause. It can [...]
d44	The population in western and central Europe has been shifting in the direction of diversity for the last seventy years, and that of the United States more or less consistently since the nation's founding. Along with diversity comes a complementary, if perhaps more gradual, shift in culture. Opposing this historical trend is the fact that anti-immigrant resistance among established national populations is almost a default position. There is ironic justice in this prospect. After all, the [...]
d45	General dental practitioners need to urgently carry out the advised dental treatment plan for these patients to avoid any delay of cancer treatment. If the preceding procedures have been completed, most patients will not need oral care during the course of their radiation therapy. However, continuing evaluation and supportive reinforcement is critical for these patients who will need to be seen in the Restorative Dentistry Oncology Clinic for dental evaluation and prosthodontic treatment if required, for management or amelioration and control of oral problems such as xerostomia, mucositis, opportunistic infection, nutritional difficulty. Radiation patients with head and neck cancer are at lifelong risk for oral disease as a result of their treatment. The possibility of tumour recurrence or persistence is significant, especially in those who continue to [...]
d46	Local responses also reflected varying local conditions and traditions of burial, often established over a long period. The epidemiology of the disease contributed to the problem: its rapid spread over short distances, its high case-fatality, the geometrical increase in weekly deaths once it had taken hold in an area, helped to concentrate most of the deaths in a parish in a relatively short period of time. The practice of shutting up whole households after one confirmed case may have increased local mortality, and also meant that the family could not take its usual share of responsibility for organizing and paying for burial - even had participation in funerals and processions not been restricted by the Plague Orders. An important [...]
d47	You really feel for the ship's resident stand-up guy, being swept aside to be replaced by new and more attractive ship entertainment, aka Cirque Fantastique. It makes the twist at the end all the more satisfying yet creepy... Thoughtful and Funny 14 Aug 2006 reviewer: Jonathan C, United Kingdom A great story about a stand up comic trying to hold on to his piece of show business. Stephen Frost captures the characture and is convincingly angry. His co-star matches him well. Sweeney's script spins a [...]
d48	The EU lives by principles which it holds sacrosanct, but which the peoples have never been asked to ratify. Secondly, in 1963, the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice was concerned narrowly with the limited and technical fields of law necessary for the maintenance of the internal market. Within these strict confines, the supremacy of European law was arguably defensible. But as the years have passed, the EU has steadily enlarged its own areas of competence, even including competences which are the core of a sovereign state without reconsidering the principle of its legal supremacy. We cannot now hand over to Brussels yet more fields of jurisdiction without [...]
d49	From 1935 until his retirement in 1944 he was a Judge of the High Court, first in Gezira Province and then in Khartoum, from time to time acting as Chief Justice. From 1942 to 1944 he was also Judge Advocate General of the Sudan Defence Force. The most considerate of men, his patience and unfailing and esteem throughout the Sudan. It was in keeping with his high standards that he became an expert in the Arabic language, since this enabled him always to hear every case in the vernacular in fairness to the accused and to avoid any suspicion of misinterpretation. He was never satisfied until he had unravelled all the complications and misunderstandings surrounding a case and, if he had to inflict a heavy sentence, he invariably explained most carefully to the prisioner his right of appeal and indeed [...]
d50	Eighteen European countries, including Ireland, The Netherlands and Spain have no ban. Eight other European countries only ban some sentenced prisoners from voting. In France and Germany, courts have the power to impose loss of voting rights as an additional punishment. The UK, along with eight other countries including Bulgaria, Romania and Russia, is in a minority of European countries in automatically disenfranchising all sentenced prisoners. The ban on prisoners voting may [...]
d51	"Inverclyde Tourist Group is a community group that welcomes tourist ships calling at Ocean Terminal, Greenock, and encourages them to spend time in Inverclyde, thereby boosting the local economy. The group, which operates from a tented stall at the quayside, offers free guided trips to local tourist attractions and provides information on sporting, leisure and shopping opportunities in the area. With 15 cruise ships set to call this summer, that adds up to lot of work. But committee member Isabel Lamb explains that it's all for the benefit of the community. Community benefit ""We aim to [...]"
d52	"Second, I was deeply distressed by Craig's failure to grasp that, by including Irving in the conversation, he was according these ""obtuse and quickly discredited"" views a new found prominence and credibility. I worried, however, that if someone such as this highly respected scholar, who knew so much about the period, could be beguiled by Irving, how much easier it would be to beguile a jury of ten [ sic. twelve ] British citizens or even a British judge. Though he hoped Irving would drop the threat of a lawsuit, Julius counseled that we must proceed as if we would end up in court. When I asked Julius how we were going to fight this, he explained that there were a number of different options open to libel defendants. They could argue that the plaintiff [...]"
d53	Everyone enjoyed the chop but especially James, as it was his first paddle in conditions so rough, his eyes firmly fixed on the destination of our starting point. The maidens took on a totally different personality from the calm of the evening before. Skye's Cullin occasionally appeared through the mist and the fresh water burns rushed off the sea pink covered grass covered with rock rose, which contrasted against the grey sky like a Monet painting. Monet would have been confused by the changing character of light and conditions we experienced throughout the week. Photos hardly do it justice, [...]
d54	"Is there a need for some kind of compulsion? Or are there some other alternatives? In an editorial in the same issue of the THES, ILT proposals do not address the real concerns , it was suggested that one of the things needed in UK higher education is a ""professional body with the power to strike off those who are seriously deficient"". The implication of this is that membership of the body (perhaps the ILT) will be compulsory and that this body would have similar powers of dismissal to those enjoyed by bodies such as the Medical Council if the member is found to be seriously deficient (presumably in teaching!). Is there a system anywhere in the world in which a teacher, at any level, can be ""struck off"" and not be allowed to [...]"
d55	You must pay for all transactions made by any additional cardholder. This applies even if the additional cardholder makes you break this agreement. We may give any additional cardholder information about your account. You may only cancel any additional card by cutting it in half and, if we ask you to, by returning it to us. We may [...]
d56	Despite a formal contradiction between the parallels the actual meaning of the two versions is identical. We are assured that giving different versions of what Jesus said and when and why has no effect on reliability. I cannot think of any religious work which would not be reliable if people are allowed to present 'might-haves' and 'could-have-beens' as unchallenged explanations of problems. Perhaps you can come up with an error in the Qur'an or the Book of Mormon which cannot be fixed by the application of Blomberg's methods. All authors are reliable if, when they report letters and conversations which took place in secret, we suppose that there must have been a sympathiser who [...]
d57	"The latter was an innovation introduced by Henry Ford, and those techniques have therefore become collectively known as ""Fordism. The productivity of the great American enterprises rose spectacularly; for example, already in the twenties countless vehicles rolled off the assembly lines of the automobile factories of Michigan every single day. But who was supposed to buy all those cars? Most Americans at the time did not have sufficiently robust pocket books for such a purchase. Other industrial products similarly [...]"
d58	"A story of poverty, disease, displacement, and a vast global population of rural and urban poor without access to life's basic needs. In this time of development 2.6 billion of the world's population have nowhere safe to go to the toilet and 1.1 billion still do not have safe water to drink. In this brave new world a child is dying every 15 seconds from easily preventable water-related diseases. This pond water is so dirty and we cannot do anything about it,"" says Zenebech Jemel from Ethiopia, who walks many hours each day to collect water. Because of the water we [...]"
d59	It strengthens every dimension of the life of the church. And many of you men can be blessed by God and grateful to Him that your wife has grown and learned things from the Word of God which can enrich her own life and her relationship to you and your family. I praise God for that. I don't believe as the press tries to paint it and as people outside try to paint it that we have a whole lot of deprived women who are bound in a traditionalism that's not true to the contemporary mentality as I read about us in this and that.

d60	Breeze snatched up the first thing she could find - her own mackintosh, which she had been wearing earlier in the day - and with one swift movement covered that smouldering sleeve with the thick material. As she dragged Susan's limp form away from the fire, she noticed with one part of her brain that a sheet of paper had just begun to burn. She saw that it was covered with badly printed words, amongst which 'Wellwisher' stood out. Just for an instant she saw it, and then the [...] 
d61	We all know how far, far short of fulfilling that great expectation we still are. Forgive me if I think first of all my fellow Africans, who are feeling the scourge of war today, even as we speak. The genocide in Rwanda and the subsequent conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have at least received worldwide publicity, even if far too little effective international action. But other wars, hardly less murderous, have been almost completely ignored. For instance: In Congo-Brazzaville, a conflict that has gone almost unnoticed by the world has claimed thousands of lives; in the first four months of this year alone, the renewal of civil [...]
d62	It does not measure up to care in the community standards. I know Highland Council is pushed and there is a big problem with funding but it is about time it gave up some of the politically- correct rubbish money is being spent on and concentrated on essential services, care for the elderly being one of them. Highland and Islands Tory MSP Mary Scanlon said the authority could be breaking the law under the Community Care Act 2001, which outlines services which should be provided locally. She added: ' I Highland Council does not have enough money it has to get more from the Scottish Executive or use the money it has more effectively. This [...]

African conflicts are easy to predict because most conflicts in Africa are never truly resolved.

d64	Known simply as ``the Bike Man,'' Stuecke ranked as the world's most-traveled man in the Guinness Book of Records between 1995 and 1999. Quiet Admiration There's a bit of Stuecke in all of us, which is why we find stories such as his so appealing. While most of us settle down to a job and family life, we also succumb to fleeting moments when we wonder whether it might not have been better just to cycle off into the horizon than spending another day paying the mortgage. When we read about men such as Stuecke, it is impossible not to admire their commitment to freedom and the open road. Yet the [...]
d65	Most blokes were ever happy just to go behind a tree - but folks elite would much prefer a toilet when they pee. But trees were rare on Doyley s plain, not one for fifty kays, whilst privacy behind a car was not part of their ways. The double-dunny Doyley owned, to most, was quite a treat, and lady-like, all dainty dames would have to have a seat. But duets on the dunny didn t favour everyone - except on odd occasions such as mother, daughter, son. Old Doyley was a crafty one and always loved a joke; he always [...]

d67	In Africa, the lives of women have not changed in a meaningful way. The women who spend eight hours a day gathering firewood are still doing that, women are still subjected to domestic violence, and employment of women remains limited to relatively few fields and relatively low jobs. Women and children are the ones who suffer most as a result of wars, political and ethnic conflicts. African women are subjected to specific constraints due to gender inequalities, and these constraints [...]

He said: 'Teenage smoking will lead to massive health problems for the next generation. Young girls are more likely to smoke than are boys. Health promotion is important, but this alone is unlikely to curb cigarette smoking among the very young.

d69	Walter Scott was born on August 15, 1771 in College Wynd , Edinburgh. He was the ninth child of Walter Scott, Writer to the Signet, and Anne Rutherford, but five of his siblings had already died in infancy, and a sixth, Barbara, was to die when he was five months old. Scott's father was heir to a junior branch of the Scotts, a bellicose and litigious clan who since the tenth century had played a prominent role in the warfare and internecine strife that wracked the Border region. On his mother's side, he descended from the Haliburtons of Newmains who brought to the Scott family the hereditary right of burial in Dryburgh Abbey. Walter senior was the first of his family to move to Edinburgh and to [...]
d70	They seemed to process information differently to normal children, and seemed specifically impaired in extracting 'meaningful structure' from stimuli. For example, whereas the normal child can recall more information in a word list if the words are meaningful, children with autism seemed equally good at memory tasks whether the items to be recalled were meaningful or meaningless. This gave an important clue that when children with autism perceive the world, they might see it very differently from the rest of us. But how was this going to explain their uniquely social difficulties? A big impetus for autism research came from an unexpected direction: researchers in developmental psychology [...]
d71	When asked about inclusive attitudes when prior experience working with children with disabilities was a factor, preservice teachers were found to exhibithigh beliefs in positive academic progress of special needs students and a propensity for having little difficulty teaching students with cognitive deficits. Conclusion Globally, inclusive practices tend to vary in their degree of implementation. Often times the attitudes and beliefs regarding inclusion of students with disabilities in general education classrooms tend to either hinder or promote its success. Teachers worldwide seem to have mixed feelings about including students with disabilities in general education settings. Age and type of disability are consistent [...]

It is not long before the hunt becomes a full-blown obsession. Quite unexpectedly, M, a man ""anchored by neither wife nor home, nor by a lover nor even a single friend,"" becomes attached to the children during those intervals he spends at the house preparing for his next excursion. At first distant but then more at ease with himself and his hosts, M gradually relinquishes those defenses that make him an expert hunter. His presence [...]"

But when, in the cold light of day, they were asked to stump up the cash they resorted to the hand wringing and excuses. Finally, we need to review the effectiveness of the medicines used and make sure that the health systems in each country are complying with best practice. For example practitioners, pharmaceutical companies and the World Health Organization appear not to agree about anti-malarial remedies. Some companies have been accused of [...]

d77	In addition to the 1.3 million hectares for liquid fuels an even greater area of SRC would be required to make more than a tiny dent in fossil fuel use for electricity generation. This all adds up to an enormous land requirement which will increase food and animal feed imports, as well as highly polluting shipping emissions and associated ghgs. The pressures on remaining global forests and wildlands will become even more acute, with bleak prospects for the poor and hungry across the world as land is taken for food exports or fuel crops. Instead of [...]
d78	"Reading The Game celebrates the launch of its second year With all the negative publicity you would think that football clubs never do anything good for their local community. Not so. Did you know that in the last year 12 football clubs have distributed nearly 3000 free books to over 900 children? These clubs were participating in the first year of Reading The Game (RTG), an initiative of the National Literacy Trust. Harnessing the motivational power of football Reading The Game works with football clubs to get books to children who might not otherwise have access to them.

The houses, dripping in an upward stream, create a strange weightlessness, beatific in their paralysing calm. Dirk Skreber's paintings yield an atmosphere of sedate dissolution, where horror and beauty are suspended beyond comprehensible scope. His [...]

d82	There are some stories that are archetypal, that resonate with all of us as human beings regardless of age, background or culture. We're all cast out of our own home at some point as a child, and we're forced to matriculate through life, struggling to find our identity. Well that metaphor on an expanded level is what Battlestar is all about - you're cast out of your homeland, struggling to survive in the most challenging conditions. Like Moses and the Israelites, roaming in the desert for 40 years, having to come together as a group moving in the same direction. I just think that this epic [...]

Ivans surrendered to the temptation, and applied the weight of his finger to the switch.

How did the Universe evolve into the form we see today?

It was not until the Early 90s that these stalls were raided and the festival bootlegs declined. By Then a new format was revolutionising the industry Bootleggers were quick to realise the potential of CDs and the record companies were desperately slow.

It therefore tends to be worse in winter when viral infections such as colds and flu are more common. Emphysema Emphysema is another form of lung disease. Like chronic bronchitis, in most people it is caused by smoking, which damages the elastic supporting structure of the air sacs within your lungs. About two percent of people with emphysema lack a protein called alpha antitrypsin. The absence of this protein makes people more likely to [...]
d90	In practice, its brutal methods have been directed largely against the region's civilian population. Its fighters have pillaged and burned entire villages, carried out massacres, mutilated people and, most notoriously, abducted children. The UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) estimates that 25,000 children have been kidnapped by the LRA since the conflict began, nearly half of them since 2002. Abducted boys and girls have been forced to fight and serve as porters, while many girls have also been pressed into sexual slavery. The [...]

Illiterate, too, may mean illiterate in English, but not illiterate when it comes to reading the Koran. The Guardian's line of reasoning is quite spurious and designed to deceive.

Women in burqas were part of the death squads operation as they hid pistols beneath their veils and shot down ISIS fighters in brave attacks at checkpoints. A squad of gunmen shot down the head of the cult's Caliphate Cubs wing in a broad daylight attack which left warlords living in fear - with ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi refusing the travel anywhere without armed guards. Rebellious youths have also reportedly began forming ""combat detachments"" in a bid to purge the cult from Mosul and a mysterious [...]"
d95	The chalets scattered round the southern half of the island were extremely comfortable. Above all though, the lasting impression should be one of tranquillity and relaxation. Perhaps the most exacting thing one had to do was remove one's shoes on entry into any of the buildings and wash your feet in the basin of water left outside each front door. If the strain of that is all too much, then sit on the wooden veranda, iced beer in hand, gazing out to the horizon and watch the distant moon rise like a giant inflating marsh mallow....

d98	This also puts a sense of doubt in British Muslims as to whether they are even allowed to start voicing their opinions about these legislations without being labelled as extremists. Thirdly, it is imperative that we understand the diversity, breadth and conviction of British Muslim views. One major view is that deprived Muslims around the world are being forgotten and are frequently suffering from acts of terrorism. Muslims often get caught in the middle of a conflict between world powers or are subject to degrading treatment. To many within our country, there is considerable doubt over the legitimacy of the war with Iraq. Is this [...]

The results of the study, which was conducted by Professor Dominic Abrams, Tim Hopthrow, Lorne Hulbert and Daniel Frings at the University of Kent, indicate that with moderate social drinking groups may provide an informal means of mutual regulation and monitoring that can offset some aspects of 'alcohol myopia'. Professor Abrams explained: Until now, research on the effects of alcohol has focused largely on individuals. For example, as a result of [...]

d102	Both men quoted somewhat largely from Scripture, and now and then made use of a phrase leading to the belief that at some time or other they had preached in village pulpits. [...] During 1872 Charles Jay toured numerous Essex villages, and to audiences of agricultural workers, often numbering 300 or more, he spoke of the advantages from united action. At one meeting, for example, he and Joseph Arch (the chairman of the National Agricultural Labourers' Union) promised that he would guarantee to those who joined the union 13/- a week in winter and 15/- in summer. If they could not get these wages the Union would support them in the unfortunate event of a strike. Jay's belief in migration of the labourers was reinforced in 1873 when he was appointed an agent of the Queensland Government to [...]
d103	"Their goal is clear: To cause chaos in Egypt and bring down its democratic system, a system that had once brought them to power, however, their reign was neither fruitful nor remarkable. It was less than mediocre; disastrous. To avenge themselves, they are trying to spread poverty and destruction by spreading false information or ""alternative facts,"" as Kellyanne Conway, Counsellor to Donald Trump would call them. In short, the spread lies with the aim of scaring and terrorising people and bringing down morale, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that Egypt does not progress. Doha's regime and the Muslim Brotherhood have repeatedly attempted to destabilize Egyptian society and [...]"
d104	If they share most basic assumptions, so that it is easy to arrive at clear-cut, mutually accepted definitions of terms, then facts and logic come to the fore. The argument is mostly a matter of filling in missing information and identifying unrecognized inconsistencies in one position or the other. But there is a whole other challenge when the disputants do not share assumptions and their meanings are subtly divergent. Then, before the task of engagement can be reduced to a factual and logical exercise, each person must find a way to make his terms conceivable to the other. This typically requires the use of metaphor; only through a kind of cognitive leap can we [...]

The other source of kidneys is from a relative (e.g. a brother, sister or parent) or spouse (partner) who wants to donate a kidney and who has the right blood group and suitable kidney cell markers (the tissue type).

d111	"Marx goes on to summarise the communist critique of the false bourgeois conceptions of freedom, individuality, culture, the family and education, attacking in particular the oppression of women within bourgeois society. After this, he outlines the nature of the proletarian revolution, ""to raise the proletariat to the position of the ruling class, to win the battle of democracy"", and identifies the resulting state with ""the proletariat organised as the ruling class"". The 10-point political programme for the first steps of the revolution with which this section ends, is interesting mainly for its surprisingly mild character. Clearly, Marx does not consider revolution as a sudden overnight transformation, resulting from some kind of coup d'État, however violent it might be. He refers to the situation following a prolonged historical transition, when in the course of development class [...]"

d113	The 1970s were a period of marking time. The Heath government of 1970-74 did not rely so much on irregular advisers, but continued to have some. Its main innovation was the Central Policy Review Staff, under Lord Rothschild, which was meant to give the prime minister and the cabinet non-departmental views, especially on longer term issues. It was composed of a mixture of political and civil service appointees; but their bias was would-be technocratic and interventionist, rather than partisan. It was abolished by Margaret Thatcher -- largely it was thought out of pique when she blamed it for [...]

The book does not tell you what you should do, but it really does not have too because the evidence the authors provide is so compelling, that anyone who reads this book will think twice about their next purchase at the store. The book also explores the nature by which large corporations such as Novartis and Monsanto are able to [...]

When the smaller poorer nations of the world cannot get their hands on the black stuff to help feed, clothe, transport and employ their own burgeoning populations are they going to wait for aid to come, wait for outside assistance and hope the price of crude falls once more, are they going to remain quiet and just on with things or are they going to fight their neighbours to seize whatever energy resources it can?

This is Mr Chavez's second noisy diplomatic spat in as many months. A war of words broke out earlier this year between Colombia and Venezuela, after the abduction of a leading member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Farc, in Caracas. Mr Chavez said Colombia had violated Venezuela's sovereignty, while Colombia's right-wing government accused Mr Chavez of harbouring members of the Marxist organisation.

In a computing context is the binary, machine-readable information that is stored and read. While there are often distinctions made between plain text ASCII files and what are considered data files, both are stored as binary bits and bytes at the machine level, and are therefore both within the realm of what we are discussing.

d118	Every time we get towards the edge of human understanding, there it is: medicine, environmental modelling, cosmology, fluid dynamics, cognition all have their massive sets of cheap processors grinding away in the darkness, pressing out into the light. It's also a great tool for turning pure human will into machinery. Take the story that an ad-hoc network of volunteers are busy decoding some old and uncracked Kriegsmarine Enigma messages from U-boats in World War II. There can be nothing less urgent than a daily report from a captain hiding in the middle of the Atlantic sixty years ago, and in the normal run of things it would be impossible to get enough official resources to make this happen. But that doesn't matter: it's within the capability of enthusiasts to write some client code to [...]

d120	This was especially true on the occasions when Gogol's imagination ran away with him and he would suddenly change roles, often from week to week. As a young man in 1829 he published a long poem, Hans Kuchelgarten, to bad reviews. Mortified, he left St Petersburg for Germany, claiming in a letter to his mother that he was fleeing due to his unrequited love for a woman with 'a radiant face'. He drew a vivid picture of the suffering of a lover, which, however, he instantly forgot, and in his next letter told her that the main reason he had come to Germany was for his health. His mother not unnaturally concluded from these two strange missives that her son [...]

It was a time when Modernist notions of function were in question and the issue of the interplay of form and function in design was much debated.

d139	Each of the Northern Transvaal samples did manifest a slightly higher degree of both uncertainty and a 'sense of threat' which does fit with the attitudes one would expect given the enormous political change they were facing. In both territories, those who were uncertain about the future were more likely to feel their community was under threat; this accords with the hypothesis that people will manufacture generalised beliefs to help them cope with an uncertain and confused situation. This latter theory may also explain the prevalence in all six fieldwork congregations of the belief that Afrikaners/Protestants were being discriminated against in terms of jobs because of affirmative action policies in South Africa and fair employment legislation in Northern Ireland. There was a correlation in both the aggregated fieldwork samples between one's degree of 'alienation' and one's theological stance; the theologically 'conservative' were more likely than their 'liberal' counterparts to feel alienated from the political system. This is perhaps not surprising, given that those who take the Bible very literally are probably more likely to feel the [...]

In 1973 Peter Shaffer wrote Equus, which opened at the National Theatre and quickly attracted popular acclaim. Within a year it was moved to Broadway where it ran for over a thousand performances, winning the Tony Award and the Drama Critics Award for best play. In 1974 Sir Anthony Hopkins' acting career was launched in the USA making his debut in Equus playing Dr. Martin Dysart winning the New York Drama Desk Award and the Outer Critics' Circle Award for best actor.

This proposal and the way in which it is presented reflects the Government's approach of dragging workers' conditions back into the 19th century while shouting slogans of ""modernisation"" and ""moving into the 21st century"". The Green Paper also proposes raising the pension age of public service workers from 60 to 65 for new entrants, while not ruling out that at some later date this could be extended to existing public service workers like teachers and nurses. It also floats the balloon of raising the state pension age to 70, while making no definite proposal to do so. Clearly the government is [...]"

Admittedly, it is unlikely that this would have appealed to rebels and their sympathisers but it surely did to others in Ulster and perhaps elsewhere. At the very least, Curtin's and Bartlett's research suggests that an examination of the role of the magistracy in the aftermath of the rebellion might yield some interesting results. There are two other essays to be considered. Tommy Graham [...]

Findings Qualitative data analysis identified 3 styles of decision-making. This was used to classify women according to the way in which they had made their decision for or against breast reconstruction: 1. immediate/instant decision-makers (n = 78),- these women reported making easy, intuitive decisions whilst still in the consultation in which reconstruction was first discussed. Typically, one option was sufficiently salient as to facilitate a quick decision, yet factors such as hospital systems also appeared to facilitate this style of decision-making. These women sought information only after they had made their decision and this was a selective search that avoided information that might [...]

Indeed a boycott by Sunni parties, and voters, remains a very large threat.

As the U.S. tries to help set up a new Iraqi government, the exile groups that many U.S. officials hoped Iraqis would rally around have won little popular support.

Topography speaks, even without people: a dry landscape in Brazil makes it easier to understand back-country evangelists, a minor hill-fort in mid-Wales the no-man's-land of medieval marches. At times cities used to speak louder than words, and some still do: St Petersburg, for instance, or, until its gadarene post-Communist decline, Prague.

d166	So far, the defence arguments in Düsseldorf have failed to make a convincing case. That, however, is largely because German law is relatively untested in this field, and corporate governance codes are immature. Although a new code follows the British practice and enjoins companies to set out in detail before shareholders the various component parts of individual directors' pay packages, few of them, if any, obey the new rules (which, in the UK, mean that remuneration reports often run to a dozen complicated pages). The outcome of the trial is unlikely to be jail sentences for the accused, although it may well bring hefty fines. But it certainly [...]

d170	Aristophanes appears genuinely to have objected to what he saw as social instability brought on by the freedom Athenian youths enjoyed to study with professional rhetoricians, sophists, and natural philosophers, e.g., those who, like the presocratics, studied the cosmos or nature. That Socrates eschewed any earning potential in philosophy does not seem to have been significant to the comic playwright. Aristophanes' depiction is important because Plato's Socrates says at his trial ( Apology 18a-b, 19c) that most of his jurors have grown up believing the falsehoods spread about him in the play. Socrates calls Aristophanes more dangerous than the three men who brought charges against him in 399 because Aristophanes [...]

By contrast, more and more rank-and-file members recognise the need to create alternative political representation to advance their hopes for the future.

d173	First, Porter's chapter title posing the question, 'What is Disease?' actually followed Kiple's contribution on the 'History of Disease' (Kiple's chapter, given the limitations of this type of writing, is a fine sweeping account of global historical epidemiology. He is especially strong on coupling 'big themes' - such as the agricultural revolution and urbanisation - with shifts in the disease panorama). A second instance arose in the way that Shorter's account of the importance of medical science for the 'making of the modern doctor' (pp. 126-32) in his 'Primary Care' chapter actually preceded Porter's chapter on 'Medical Science'. To point out these issues in fact serves to stress interconnectedness in the development of all aspects of disease and medicine with wider social, political and economic forces. How these [...]

Prudence watches out for ""opportunity (which haveth a bushy forehead, and being bald-pated, and moreover having wings, does quickly slip away) and catcheth it"". This is Comenius's Angelus Novus - who in Benjamin is the one facing the past, while propelled to the future, by the storm of progress caught in his wings. If the angel of history could propose a mode of seeing in order to act, he would carry out the paradoxical act of putting the world back together again - he would like to rest awhile, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed - and smashing to pieces its old order - the one that made fascism possible.

For example in a death in custody case where the relatives or friends of the deceased will not be witnesses of fact so cannot be tainted by the disclosure. The extent of disclosure will have to depend on a risk assessment by the IO of whether information is likely to be passed on by the complainant or the family to other witnesses or to the media.

d180	Russia was not as advanced as France in many areas and Schlieffen believed that Russia would take six weeks to mobilise her forces and that any possible fighting on the Russian-German border could be coped with by the Germans for a few weeks while the bulk of her forces concentrated on defeating France. Schlieffen concluded that a massive and successful surprise attack against France would be enough to put off Britain becoming involved in a continental war. This would allow Germany time (the six weeks that Schlieffen had built into his plan) to transfer soldiers who had been fighting in the successful French campaign to Russia to take on the Russians. Schlieffen also planned for the attack on France to go through Belgium and Luxemburg. Belgium had had her neutrality guaranteed by Britain in 1839 - so his strategy for success depended on Britain not supporting Belgium. The Schlieffen Plan was revised as [...]

While the foundation has given Hunter a new reason for making money, he is also keen to encourage other business people to follow his example. ""I would say to any wealth creator, 'Why wait until you are dead for your legacy to carry on - that was the old model. Why let someone else have the fun of [...]"
d183	It, the hand, verifies and locates. It is the point of immediate contact between the artist and the world, the source of the physical, and hence of the individually made object. But the hand is not the dumb instrument of the brain anymore than the soul, is the motor of the body. The two are not joined as two separate entities, but in an 'informed union', in scholastic terms a substantial union, real, whole, complete. This union is in some sense analogous to the artist's relation with his work, where the hand informs matter, [...]

'In the autumn of 1891, Yersin's contract with the Messageries ended and he began exploring full-time, leading a major expedition from Nha Trang to Phnom Penh in Cambodia.

d186	The rising tide of ethnic and religious identity is the unavoidable result of bringing different peoples and cultures into far closer proximity than is natural. The technology which built the jet-fighter and tanks, which imposed the post-war partition of the world on a myriad of resentful nations, also created throw-away, shoulder-to-air missiles with which illiterate tribesmen can blast them and their crews to pieces. The electronic wizardry which led first to the creation of centralised television networks which put unprecedented brainwashing power in the hands of a few hundred men, has now gone on to make video cameras, personal computers and the Internet -- a combination which, if they do not find a way to bring it under control with in a couple of years, will do for the previous information monopoly what the development of the longbow did for the mounted knights who had ruled the battlefields of Europe for hundreds of years. Time running out This leads us on to the last [...] 
d187	I was later stationed in Pleiku and Saigon. In addition to pictures taken for the government, I took many more of the Vietnamese civilians, particularly children--probably over 1500 images. Recently, I've been reviewing the bulk of this portfolio in an attempt to determine their relevance to the culture and history of the period. My hope is to preserve these photos as documentary material, recording this era in Vietnam's history on CD-ROM in the form of a self-guided multimedia presentation. The theme underlying the portfolio is the effect of the war upon the Vietnamese people and how the [...]

Of the comprehensive plan only the road atlas and plans of London and Westminster were achieved. A Royal Warrant of 24 August 1671 authorised John Ogilby, Royal Cosmographer, to make the necessary surveys and enquiries, with access to public records. Ogilby issued sets of 'Queries' to provide some standard approach to the data gathering for his county mapping. Hooke, Aubrey and Wren, Fellows of the Royal Society, were involved in [...]
d189	What I mean by that is: If it's internal, I mean is it coming from your heart? Is it your intuition, your gut instinct telling you that he just isn't the one, because that can happen, even with the most wonderful men, the ones who are good and trustworthy who tick all the right boxes... sometimes as much as we want that to be true, if the spark doesn't last, it's unlikely that your marriage will. Could it just be the fact that you just don't have that spark anymore? You can will it back as much as you want, but maybe your body's telling you something? Could it be external influences that are [...]
d190	Three years ago in Chester the counsel for the defence had simply given up at this point, shrugging the shoulders and grinning apologetically at his client Mrs Clark, who hung her head, knowing that she'd come to the end of the road. There had been no need to depart from that pattern in the two dozen trials since. Until now. The smartly-dressed ethnic young lady who took to the floor with such apparent confidence had clearly been shockingly briefed. The hearts of the spectators in the gallery went out to her, knowing the [...]

Above, on either side, there was a recess railed with iron, perhaps two feet wide and four long, which stood for orchestra and seats of honour. In the one balcony, five slatternly Irish lasses sat woven in a comely group. In the other was posted Orpheus, his body, which was convulsively in motion, forming an odd contrast to his somnolent, imperturbable Scots face. His brother, a dark man with a vehement, interested countenance, who made a god of the fiddler, sat by with open mouth, drinking in the general admiration and [...]

d193	The illusion the OS get away with is to make us think their scheme started with Sheet 1 and was worked out southwards down to Sheet 204. But a close look at the back cover shows that the whole stupid arrangment arises from sheets 176 and 177 - which were evidently the first to be defined, as these two sheets alone have a helpful, small, symmetrical overlap with all adjoining sheets. Yes, of course... West London and East London. One of the few areas in Britain where Landranger maps are almost entirely useless, as they don't show street names, which is precisely why everyone in London uses an A-Z instead.

d195	It soon became apparent that Evans had tapped into a huge public appetite for nostalgia on the web. His site, remembertheeighties.com, specialises in following the careers of Eighties stars ranging 'from Bucks Fizz to Megadeath' who are still performing today, giving fans the chance to catch their latest concert or album. It now claims to be the world's most popular 'Eighties news resource' with more than one million hits per month, and distributes a newsletter to 18,000 people every week. The much chronicled revival of the decade's fashions and culture is reflected in a survey by remembertheeighties.com which asked 5,000 members what summed it up for them. The list of 40 was headed by the Rubik's Cube, the fiendish puzzle which challenged its owner to twist and turn blocks until the [...]
d196	With SP2 around the bend, Microsoft's seemingly unbreakable grip on the desktop begs the question of whether there's any threshold that, once crossed, could ignite an exodus from Windows. Although SP2 is being hailed as a major stake in the ground for Microsoft from a security perspective, Microsoft can still afford some post-SP2 transgressions without suffering any major setbacks. This could explain why the company is being so careful not to over-promise when it comes to SP2. Recall that prior to Windows XP shipping in October 2001, Microsoft was hailing the operating system as a significant step forward on the security front. Yet, the security patches, including one that plugged a serious Universal Plug and Play vulnerability, began flowing within weeks and [...]

d199	This can be the keystone of the defence as well, although the defendant might be prepared to accept the plaintiff's evidence if it contains nothing controversial. At this stage it is worth emphasising that we still deal with personal injury litigation under an adversarial system.

At each there was tremendous enthusiasm for what Respect has to say. The rallies helped [...]
d205	The samples are small, and given that they are drawn from eight cities per sweep, they are unlikely to be representative of the country as a whole. Participation is voluntary and urine test data are not adjusted to take account of the differences in the half-life of drugs (for example, amphetamines remain testable in urine for two days; opiates, cocaine and benzodiazepines for three days; and cannabis up to a month with chronic users). The results thus need cautious interpretation (see Stimson et al., 1998). Nevertheless they give a good idea of the 'order of magnitude' of the relationships between illicit drug use, dependence and offending in this population. Consistent [...]

The birth took a little while; a suitable venue had to be chosen, space found in the calendar and enough officials press-ganged to make it viable. The entry qualifications were modified to make it as easy as possible for people to enter; entries were taken on the day, for a modest increase in the already very low entry fee. No membership subscription was required and the sequence to be flown was carefully designed for very modest power and performance characteristics. A low number of pre-entries [...]

d209	In 1999, lots with over 1,000 head of cattle comprised 2% of all feedlots, but marketed 85% of feed-lot cattle. Those with over 32,000 (think about that - 32,000) head, comprised much less than 1% of lots, but produced 40% of feed-lot cattle. Take sheep - in New Zealand, long exposed to world markets, sheep are effectively ranched, and survival of the fittest, both animals and businesses is the order of the day. Livestock producers in the UK cannot hope to compete with this low cost production. Indeed, there are even signs now that the US is becoming worried about even lower-cost imports [...]
d210	In Tyldesley , the employers offered the comparator a higher rate of pay because they perceived him to be better qualified However, the position under Marshall, Tyldesley and Wallace may have been changed by a recent decision of the ECJ: Brunnhofer v Bank der Österreichischen Postsparkasse AG [2001] IRLR 571 . The Brunnhofer decision suggests that there may be a requirement for an employer to objectively justify a difference in pay even where no discrimination has been established. In Brunnhofer, the claimant and comparator were in the same job category under a collective agreement but the comparator received an individual supplement higher than the supplement received by the claimant. There was no evidence of what might be characterised as direct or indirect discrimination, yet the ECJ held that the employer must have objectively justified and proportionate reasons to explain the difference in pay between a woman and a man undertaking equal work. This appears to [...]
d211	The anonymous Farther Excursions of the Observant Pedestrian , published in 1801, has an 'Introductory' which states 'without the incitement of a name, or patron to establish his celebrity', the earlier Observant Pedestrian (1795) enjoyed unexpected success. While a patron was not essential, it was clearly a well established feature of successful publication, and a guarantee that the author's name would appear, if so desired. In the preface to Falconbridge Abbey , Hanway remarks '[she] boldly ventured to launch my little skiff on the tremendous ocean of criticism [...] those sunken rocks, denominated the Reviewers!' Reviewers in journals such as the Critical Review were greatly feared, their word being relied on as a guide to suitable reading matter.

d212	When I first read Major Buckley's article on St Teilo's Well in Source 2, I confess to having been devilishly amused at the number of people I was sure it would annoy. Like everybody else, I had swallowed the story without checking it because it was endorsed by impeccable sources, and seeing it so utterly debunked had a certain anarchistic frisson! I am not sure that the idea of the 'head-cult' need be entirely discarded; but it obviously needs drastic revision from the inflated statements that have been made about it. Firstly, the idea that the 'head-cult' is exclusively or even predominately Celtic is very dubious, if all we have to go on are examples of folk stories involving heads which are extrapolated backwards to produce a religious motif. A few disparate [...]

They are quite evident: everyone perceives the game in his own way (with the help of his imagination), but at the same time, if the game is rather good, a special field of common perception and mood is formed. It's not an allegation as the author has great experience of playing table RPG and so he knows all ins and outs.

d217	Rather, the project of examining this volume in the context of Reed's relationship with Wordsworth has consequences for our current understanding of 'British Romanticism', a category which has served, in its various instantiations since the late nineteenth century, as an important organising moment for the study of a certain period in the history of English Literature. Thus, my aim here is not simply to call attention to the relationship between Reed and Wordsworth, but rather to extrapolate from that relationship implications it has for the study of Romantic-period writing and ultimately the study of literary texts in general. First, some implications for the study of British Romanticism. The [...]

Elections in May should have offered powerful evidence for the bedding down of democracy, with up to 25 million voting for new members of parliament. Sceptics predicted that the exercise of democracy would be undermined by repression and intimidation in some areas, but others pointed out that after so long as a one-party state, where government critics were killed in the ""Red terror"", it could only be a sign of progress that such elections took place at all.

d231	Painting at the Royal College of Art from 1948, the practise has flourished to provide fresh challenges for subsequent generations of artists. This exhibition explores the many directions taken by portraiture, focusing on paintings of eminent sitters. At times the portrait reflects the subject's public persona, but commissions are comparatively rare, and it is often the artist's intimacy with the subject that gives the work its strength, combining a capturing of appearance with psychological penetration. The exhibition takes as its starting point Coldstream's Portrait of Howard Griffin , a painting of the writer and poet, who shared with Coldstream a friendship with Auden, and Moynihan's Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon , a testament to the two men's close friendship. In each case the [...]

d236	And thus, our version of the Lady of the Lake traveled to the outside as a video, combining spoken poetry and visuals, recording us in the very countryside we were talking about. This provided a very useful vehicle for allowing our imaginations to soar, and our writing and our stories became wilder, as everyone realized that a different set of rules, or strategies, commands the universe of video-making than that of live art. Embodiment as a reservoir and repetition of knowledge played an interesting part in the way that memories became retrievable, and entered from the privateinto the social: when we were exploring the connection between our childhood memories and the story, most of us pointed to moments of outside physical activity as a pivotal point in our memories: walking in a group of school children, standing by a gate in the garden, playing in a field.

Finally, the woman died. Now then, at the resurrection, whose wife will she be of the seven, since all of them were married to her? And liberal false teachers can be so polite.

d242	"And, amidst a conflict with SF as to what the content of these contacts had been, the government was forced to admit its first, self-serving version was incorrect. A further means of influence has been to blackball, or alternatively to cultivate, particular journalists or organisations. Thus, in the early days of the 'troubles', when the British army was in many ways running the show, Simon Winchester of the Guardian described how he had been ""punished with the one weapon the army could use with effect against me - the denial of information"" for naming a very senior officer who had talked to him on the expectation of remaining anonymous. On the other hand, he notes how the Sunday Times was used by government after the Bloody Sunday massacre in 1972 to [...]"

That way the better teams thrive and the less capable disappear. That is not an option due to FIA rules. The USF1 [...]

There are logics, closely connected to process algebras like CCS, which only can be expressed with deep inference, and they are expressed in the calculus of structures.

The second half had barely started before Burnley scored again. To the crowd's delight Grewcock's cross from the right was met by Britton, who made the most of a moment of freedom to leave Cass stranded. At the other end Neenan prevented Godfrey from scoring with an acrobatic save, but he was powerless when the ball reached Comfort from Brooks on the right. Comfort reacted with a shot of quality that reduced Burnley's lead and many in the crowd to near tears as the [...]

And we will allow councils to refuse applications for retrospective planning permission where it is clear that the applicant knew they were breaking the law.

Instilling good, solid, old-fashioned values into one's children is a fearsome task for every right-thinking parent. It is one that has been made infinitely harder by the arrival of those people from IX!Potl. I fully accept that the folk from IX!Potl are probably fine people, with an ancient culture that would make a fascinating documentary series on BBC 2 (with a proper RADA-trained actor to do the voice-over, in immaculate Received Pronunciation). However, this does not mean it is a good idea to let them have free reign to express their views, potentially [...]

In the framework, the visual realisation is provided through the representation space, which reflects the actions taken in the design space.

Capitalist production depends on the division of labour (manual and mental labour, the fragmentation of productive tasks), each worker being only one link in an immense chain. Capitalism forms a hierarchy, with workers engaged in permanent competition with one another in the labour market. But capitalism also develops globally, across frontiers, and [...]

They explore the scope for processes that use resources more efficiently and create less waste and pollution. They analyse corporate behaviour in each area, and how this is affected by economic factors, expertise and the local regulatory and policy environment, to identify opportunities and barriers to far-reaching change in our production systems. This book is based on the report of a major research project on the social, economic and technical [...]

d293	While the Kazan-Brando film looks backward to the thirties in its working class locale, the Ray-Dean film is more characteristic of the new emphasis of Hollywood on the problems that affluence was bringing the middle classes. The film as a commentary on its times Hollywood's new responsibilities in the war years led some to look forward to less escapist, more adult American movies. Certainly the socially conscious writers and directors who came to the film capital from the East hoped for a more decentralised process of film-making as the old authoritarian studios lost their power. Except for the most successful directors, and for a number of B pictures, such hopes were generally unrealised. Yet On the Waterfront did set a standard for a more co-operative film-making tradition based in New York; Sam Spiegel strictly [...]

We may assume that this mind does not belong to Uday. These developments are creating alarm and our government is anxious to remind us of Mr Hussein's inconceiveable wickedness.

As a result of changes required by the European Equal Treatment Directive, for the first time, UK legislation says that women who are sexually harassed at work do not need to show that a man would have been treated differently. In the past, a common defence from employers was that there was no case to hear as the men in the office were being subject to the same behaviour. Now women only need to prove that they were treated in a way relating to their sex which violated their dignity, or was intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive.

d307	This wasn't just a play on words, rather it was a demand that they should 'maintain a consistency between their words and their actions'. But I agree, that still does not absolve them from the need to speak truth to power.

The Campaign, established in response to the development, has an extensive database of active supporters. We are not, as sometimes depicted, a romantic minority, obstructing progress. We are thousands of tax paying citizens desperately concerned about the effect of these proposals upon our lives. We do not need to speculate: our concerns are based upon the experience of the lawyers, transportation experts, planners, environmentalists, local government officials, magistrates, probation officers, doctors and social workers who, when not [...]

It is unquestionable that they must and will develop their initiative to achieve their demands. The fire-fighters' cause is just. Article Index Interview with an East London Firefighter WDIE interviewed a firefighter, an FBU representative at Stratford, East London, on picket duty on November 14.

d312	"Bolton said Washington was ""keeping a close watch on Syria"" for any signs of ""nuclear weapons intent"" and charged that it had stocks of chemical weapons and was pursuing a biological capability. The Beirut daily As-Safir points out that all these American signals were subsequently ""interpreted"" by the Israelis themselves, whose chief military intelligence researcher, Yossi Kupferwasser, came up with renewed allegations that Syria has been concealing proscribed weapons on Iraq's behalf, coupled with recommendations that the Americans should put Damascus and Hizbullah next on their hit list after they're done with ""regime change"" in Baghdad. According to Syrian sources quoted by As-Safir, the view in Damascus is that the US and Britain have embroiled themselves in a fight in Iraq that ""will last for months. They contemptuously dismissed warnings about what they were letting themselves in for, and plunged recklessly into an invasion of the country ""in compliance with Israeli doctrines and incitement. Arab newspapers note that in replying formally to Powell, Damascus [...]"

Post-trading estate An area of boggy ground to the west of Slough was used to store huge numbers of motor vehicles coming back from the First World War in Flanders. Local engineering companies sprung up to service this ready resource, and, in the early 1920s, these companies formed the Slough Trading Estate, one of the first such Industrial Estates in the world. Spectacular growth and employment ensued, with Slough [...]

Another thing that enraged me about the Southern Baptist church was that in a recent abortion clinic bombing a nurse was killed and a prominent priest came out and said she shouldn't be grieved for because she was aiding in the murder of children.

d317	A ferocious scene such as this - in which we are made to experience something anew, in a completely fresh, raw, painful way - is so rare in the cinema that I urge people to see Caché almost for this one supremely powerful moment alone. If it were not for this scene, however, the film would still certainly have plenty of intriguing eccentricities to recommend it. Haneke's direction is at all times precise, intense and simultaneously detached, playing games with our perceptions of events, inviting us to question everything that we see. The rendering of all the characters is - thanks to superb performances from (in particular) Juliette Binoche and Daniel Autueil - unfalteringly realistic, yet also retains enough mystery and indefinable strangeness to never become mundane. The [...]

Canvey looked sharp from the off, and Jeff Minton could have scored in the first few minutes if not for an excellent save by Mel Capleton. But Grays came back into the game and showed good pressure including efforts from Freddie Eastwood and Danny Hayzelden. On 24 minutes, referee Mr Cairns was forced into a change of strip, donning a Canvey keeper's jersey in order to distinguish himself from Blues' dark away kit.

In April 2006, demonstrators from the All-Polish Youth also attacked a March for Tolerance in Krakow, pelting it with stones and eggs. 'Intolerance has reached the highest levels of Poland's government, and it brings the menace of violence in its train,' said Human Rights Watch's Scott Long. Polish political leaders must condemn the voices of hatred, and affirm that human rights are for all.

d320	One preliminary thought on Kireji in a English verse: When you write a starting verse (hokku) of renku in Japanese, you are encouraged to use a kireji, a cutting word, to make this specially important verse be substantial and independent. This does not mean all hokku have to have a cutting word such as -ya, -kana, or -keri. But some understanding on the concept of kireji might be helpful for renkujin. To make a long history short, if I dare, the starting verse of renku (called hokku or tateku or standing verse) left the renku world and became a haiku and the the following verses of renku called hiraku or horizontal verses are said to be the origin of senryu. During the course of time this [...]

d322	News of this amazing tree was nearly lost forever A confidential source, whose account we've been able to independently confirm, revealed that a billion-dollar drug company in the United States tried for nearly seven years to synthesize two of the tree's most powerful anticancerous chemicals. In the early 1990s, behind lock and key, this well-known drug giant began searching for a cure for cancer--while preciously guarding their opportunity to patent it and, therefore, profit from it. Research focused on a legendary healing tree called Graviola. Parts of the tree--including the bark, leaves, roots, fruit, and fruit seeds--had been used for centuries by medicine men and native Indians in South America to treat heart disease, asthma, liver problems, and arthritis. Going on little documented scientific evidence, the company [...]

But the cost-benefit calculation for whole families to move is much more uncertain. Third, many of the Central and East Europeans seeking employment in Britain are already here. The main effect of May 1st was not to lure in huge numbers of new job-seekers, but to legalise the status of the many Central and East Europeans already hard at work in the UK's catering, childcare and building industries. The labour shortages in the booming economy of South-East England [...]
d324	"""Sacred polyphony,"" the Holy Father said Saturday after a concert held in his honor by the Domenico Bartolucci Foundation, ""especially the so-called 'Roman school,' is a legacy that must be carefully conserved, maintained alive and made known. It will be of ""benefit not only to scholars and enthusiasts, but to the ecclesial community as a whole, for which it represents an inestimable spiritual, artistic and cultural heritage,"" the Pope said, after the concert in the Sistine Chapel. An authentic updating of sacred music cannot occur except in line with the great tradition of the past, of Gregorian Chant, and of sacred polyphony,"" the Pontiff added. This is why,"" Benedict XVI said, ""in the musical field, as well as in that of other artistic forms, the ecclesial community has always promoted and supported those who investigate new expressive ways without [...]"

Ignoring the call to arms, Aran Aranson, chief of the Rockfall clan, is in the grip of a mad obsession borne of a magical map and dreams of sailing the frozen seas to Sanctuary, island of legend, to find a fortune.

This would enable any errors or omissions to be pointed out before any transfer takes place. Curiously, the government is equivocal on this.

If anything, they were actually helped by the mountain of evidence. If a haystack gets big enough, the odds only increase that there will be a few needles hidden inside. Whatever they managed to find, they made the most of: in closing arguments, for instance, Cochran compared Fuhrman to Adolf Hitler and called him ""a genocidal racist, a perjurer, America's worst nightmare, and the personification of evil."" His only real audience was the jury, many of whom had good reason to dislike the Los Angeles Police Department, but the team managed to [...]"

Most tutors will mark using percentage marks for each bit of the assessment, or it may be that you agree that all of the marks for this module should be allocated to the final assessment - this would show a weighting of 100% to the final assessment. Alternatively you may decide that the final assessment should have a certain proportion of the total allocated to it and the interim assessment the remainder - so you may agree that the weighting of the interim assessment is 30% and the final assessment is 70%. Each of the assessments will still be marked out of 100. If you want further explanation you should [...]

On softer metals (gunmetal, brass, aluminium etc.) Use nitromors, then carefully work at the rest of the paint to avoid damaging the underlying metal. Thoroughly clean the surface (e.g. with cellulose thinners) Apply an appropriate primer (if not explicitly told not to in the instructions for the top coat eg.

No one of them at least was in his eyes the guest of the evening. Valentin was expecting, for special reasons, a man of world-wide fame, whose friendship he had secured during some of hisvgreat detective tours and triumphs in the United States. He was expecting Julius K.

Conversely, anything that is perceived as a delaying tactic is only likely to [...]
d358	Private propriety, private ownership appeared indeed to shape the appearance of the individual in the other people's minds and thus the perception developed and generalized that individual well being was intimatelly related to material possessions. The cult of individualism was born that would ultimately overtake the cult organized by the church. This newly born individualism created the desire to acquire the symbols of religious power for private individual pleasure. The mansions and castles were a first shadowing of the cathedrals and palaces but once those were there, they had to be filled and within the span of less than a century paintings, sculpures, mirrors, tapestries, rugs, and so on became all highly praised luxury commodities.

d370	But I said straight after the last election, I said that one of the things that did impress me and worry me on the doorstep was people saying to me if you are from, you know not a poor income but a middle income family, it is a lot of money to find out of your taxed income to put your children through university. And that is where we came, not arising out of a few people in Downing Street, we came to the conclusion that we were best to move to a situation where you don't have to pay any fees going through university but the graduate makes a repayment afterwards. And when you look round the world and see the countries doing best in higher education - Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States of America - this is the system, with variants, that they have got and that is why we have done it.

A little background on the development of Fantasy Squash from Aidan Harrison Back in December I ran a fantasy squash game at my club in Chicago for an in house competition and the members loved it. So I tested the waters at the SSA GLOBAL Windy City Open in Jan and we had about 40 members and sponsors try to pick the winner of the event. Since then I have been trying to find an online program so I don't have to do everything by hand. At the post tournament dinner at the Windy City, John White embraced the idea of FantasySquash and thought it would be a great way for people to really see if they can predict who will win an event. With the different [...]

Even then, documentaries succeed according to HOW they present their characters, HOW their characters exist, given their reality, or HOW their stories are told.

P10K also calls for a cessation of offensive operations from the Israeli Government and the militant Palestinian Resistance, upon the arrival of the 10,000 strong P10K Force. O'Keefe and P10K coordinator Ian Hodgson were detained by ten Israeli Soldiers at 2pm Thursday as they walked along the beach into Palestinian Gaza from an area of Jewish Settlements at the northern end of the Gaza Strip. Knowing that Israel would refuse entry through the usual checkpoints into Gaza, the pair nearly caught Israeli soldiers off guard with their unconventional approach along the coastline.

At the beginning, the children worked separately, each group expressing their own experience of pain and fear through art. But the day came when they were ready to meet each other, to enjoy joint workshops led by Israeli and Palestinian artists and to see their neighbours and city in a fresh light of hope and peace. The children's paintings trace their emotional journey from fear to friendship, from suspicion to mutual trust. In line colour and collage their [...]

The sensual balmy fragrance provoking exotic images to her mind - of an eastern woman, scantily dressed in sheer mauve fabrics, the curves of her body clearly visible beneath.

d382	"Deep below the multiple layers of bitchiness, it is possible to pick out a substantive battle over the future of American novel. The line followed by Updike, Mailer and Irving is that there is a qualitative leap from journalism to literature which Wolfe has tried but failed to complete. Updike puts the argument most clearly in his New Yorker deconstruction of A Man in Full: ""So much local information, so many well-lighted settings, so much news do not quite knit into a novel powered by the human spirit as it gropes and struggles for focus. Wolfe has perhaps too many opinions for a novelist: his characters have a hard time breaking out of the illustrative mold in which they are cast."" Wolfe does not [...]"

His second (untitled) was a moody cafe blues about his object of affection, I liked the line ""A year is a long time/Just to be drinking wine"", although I can imagine some other activities which may stretch time a little longer.

Despite being Africa's longest running war, the 19-year conflict between the Ugandan government and the rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), has never been formally addressed by the UN Security Council. The UK must use its presidency to push the crisis onto the Council's agenda, say aid agencies. 'The [...]

In order to do that, he very properly saw all the relevant family members, including the maternal grandparents and the mother's two children by a former partner, who happens to be the father's brother, and the result of that assessment is very clear. I will not cite substantial extracts from it, because it will plainly be before the judge when the judge hears the evidence of Dr Bentovim, and the judge will have to make up his mind about it.

d407	The point is, nonetheless, important, especially in the context of the unique UK countryside and the need to find a way to preserve the comprehensive and commonplace aspects of biodiversity. It is well-known that hedgerows, for many years a key feature of British countryside and an important provider of habitats for a wide range of species, have been on the decline in both quality and quantity. The destruction and degradation of these habitats has arisen through changes in agricultural practices and has resulted in a decline in many species of animals including some of the previously common (and legally well-protected) birds. In 1994 the United Kingdom government said on quantity of hedgerows: Between 1984 and 1990 there was a net loss of 23% of hedges. The main [...]
d408	"The 3 June Communication refers to the Communication on the common asylum policy and the Agenda for protection issued on 26 March 2003. Under the heading ""Basic Premises of any new approach to the International Protection regime"" it sets out a number of starting assumptions, on which the claimed need for new approaches is based, including: a crisis in the asylum system; a growing malaise in public opinion; abuse of the asylum system which, together with ""mixed migratory flows"", are on the rise and are often maintained by smuggling practices. The Communication maintains this phenomenon is a real threat to the institution of asylum and to Europe's humanitarian tradition and demands a structural response. It suggests that Member States could better deploy the major human and financial resources devoted to reception, lengthy processing and often refusing asylum claims and that there is a manifest need to explore new avenues to complement the stage-by-stage approach adopted at Tampere. While there may be some truth to some of these assumptions, Amnesty International would question whether they accurately reflect the asylum seeker's reality, as well as those political contexts which [...]"

The converted try took the score to 31-19 and should have settled the match but the Irish pack was firmly in control with strong driving mauls to compliment their efficient line-out play. Desperate Gloucester defensive tackling held Irish at bay for a time but eventually the pressure told before Olivier Magne was eventually awarded with a try by the video official for Irish that Everitt converted to eat away at the lead, 31-26. Irish kept up their non-stop momentum in the final stages of normal time with a series of driving mauls as they all piled in and inched their way to the Gloucester line before Robbie Russell was driven over, the try again awarded by courtesy of the video to level the scores at 31-31.Everitt missed the pressure kick for what would have been a match winning effort with normal time running out.

So for the left opportunity and security for all is prejudiced by reliance on markets. For the right opportunity and security for those who deserve it is only possible by greater reliance on markets.

I believe that the issue concerning the preparation of the schools and teachers has not been properly dealt with, but, for instance, we have had a lecture here from the director of APAE (institute that works with disabled people) and she mentioned a certain school she had recently visited which would be prepared to receive her students.

d431	It would at least have been worth considering the possibility that Annie's death was a bigger blow because the Darwins had known and loved her for ten years, not merely a few weeks or months. That, of course, is the problem with sociobiology. Its successes encourage proponents to apply it to excess, failing, on occasion, to take due account of other factors. Which is what stimulates the backlash that leads to the change of name. But as sociobiology books go, this is a good one, well worth reading, and sure to [...]
d432	Summarizing the foregoing points the Reich Government wish therefore to make the following declaration: Contrary to all engagements which they have undertaken in absolute contradiction to their solemn declarations, the Soviet Government have turned against Germany. They have: 1. Not only continued but, even since the outbreak of war, intensified subversive activities against Germany and Europe; they have 2. In continually increasing measure, developed their foreign policy in a tendency hostile to Germany; and they have 3. Massed their entire forces on the German frontier ready for action. The Soviet Government have thus violated treaties and [...]

d435	"Above bishops they have ""Cenones"" (probably not koinonoi , but a Phrygian word) and patriarchs above these at Pepuza. They close the door of the Church to almost every sin. They say that God , not being able to save the world by Moses and the Prophets, took flesh of the Virgin Mary, and in Christ, His Son, preached and died for us. And because He could not accomplish the salvation of the world by this second method, the Holy Spirit descended upon Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilla, giving them the plenitude which St. Paul had not ( 1 Corinthians 13:9 ). St. Jerome refuses to [...]"
d436	"In the inquiry mentioned above, Haug found that all students do have some special educational topics in their elementary teacher education, usually linked to main categories like ""mentally retarded"" or ""emotionally disturbed"". However, the effect of this approach, Haug says, is to maintain the division between ""normal"" pupils and the others. It also underlines the need for specialists when working with students categorised as having special needs. It seems that the tendency is clearly in the tradition of the psycho-medical paradigm in special education, locating deficits within individual children (Clark & al. 1995). This is a [...]"
d437	That was not my experience in a ten-year stint of community living during the seventies. And now, twenty-five years later and with the benefit of hindsight I am still certain that it was not like that. Far from being escapists, the people I shared my life with at that time were at the coal-face of reality. There was idealism, of course, because without that there would have been no experiment in the first place. But there was also the day-to-day necessities of putting food on the table, of [...]
d438	Russia's main source of wealth was farming, as the 80% of the population were peasants. However old-fashioned methods and local weather caused obstacles in growing of economy and caused terrible Famine because of all this farming did not produce enough money to buy new machinery. More ever natural resources and cheap labour encouraged forgivers to set up their industry in Russia. All these foreign industries took all the profits, leaving Russia depending on other countries.

In the seventeenth century it provided accommodation for three poor women who received fourpence a week. By the nineteenth century there were four female inmates. In 1910, the Borough Council provided new premises, known as Dorcas House, in Preston Grove, and while this was in course of construction, [...]

A Danish study in the BMJ [1] examined the relationships between alcohol consumption and high and low density lipoprotein at the start of observations, with ischaemic heart disease incidence over the following six years as the outcome measure. The study population was 2,826 men aged 53-74 years. There are many interesting results, especially the high protective effect of alcohol in men with high LDL cholesterol drinking more than 22 drinks a week. The most important result was the overall conclusion that [...]

They say our world was created in seven days and, like those who thought the earth was flat, they believe the totally unbelievable. If teachers of our children can believe in creationism who knows what other madcap ideas they may plant into innocent minds. However democratic our society may be, I would in all seriousness ban from our schools those teachers who may wish to [...]

The second story was that of a community in Rwanda of children orphaned as a result of the genocide. These children had seen their mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters brutally murdered and yet the Comic Relief reporter, sent there as part of the fund-raising campaign, said he had never witnessed such ""love and forgiveness"". It struck me that the woman whose son broke his arm could learn a thing or two from those Rwandan children. There are many things which annoy me about daytime television (namely Kilroy and Trisha on at the same time so that you're forced to watch one or the other while you're having your breakfast!), but one thing in particular is the recent proliferation of adverts [...]"
d446	As with most Christian communities of the Middle East, the Syriac Catholic Church has suffered severely as the region's stability has deteriorated in the last 100 years or so. During Iraq's civil war (2006-2007), thousands fled the violence in Baghdad and Mosul, where they had once enjoyed relative prosperity. The displaced found security in their remote ancestral villages near ancient Nineveh. Now, these once proud centers of the church - the source of many of its vocations to the priesthood and religious life - have been lost, too, as Islamic extremists invaded the Nineveh Plain in August 2014, displacing more than 100,000 Christians, as well as Yazidis and other minorities.

When I looked out of my window just after the clock had gone ten, there was not a light in the village save only at the inn. It was but a few feet from the ground, so I slipped out, and there was Jim waiting for me at the smithy corner.

Family gatherings in the Beamish household featured domestic concerts with young Sally, a more than capable pianist, as accompanist.

d450	Over the last number of years the introduction of structured resistance training into the conditioning programmes of multi-sprint sports, such as Gaelic football and hockey, has promoted widespread debate as to whether these two forms of training can be performed concurrently. To date the evidence has been inconsistent. For example, researchers have shown that when endurance training was performed in conjunction with strength training, the strength gains were not as pronounced and vice versa. Other researchers have suggested that these diverse forms of training could be performed together with training adaptations being accrued from both. This lack of clarity has unfortunately [...]
d451	[...]teams are just not managed at all (no supervision, no adherence to standards, good practices, no training), and others are just getting by as well as they can (continuous rush mode, no individual investment, no support). In addition to that we have the best biases towards certain categories of people, a general reward for non skilled workers and the absence of work (the more you do, the more you are required to exponentially do). Management is never responsible for anything, when they mess up, it is up to the lowest employee who see the problem to take on the job of the manager and drive change from bottom to top (without the training, without the support, and with the expectation the normal job will not be impacted in any matter by any other requirements). All in all, my place is so bad they now they suck (for instance, a distributing center is being built locally which will suck all the unskilled workers, and a competitor started operating from a few miles away, [...]

However, the Government will have to deal with the issue of inequalities in life expectancy between people in different parts of the country, and between different types of worker. Problems will be stored up if manual workers are expected to work until they are in their late sixties, although they have a shorter life expectancy than others. The Government must think about today's pensioners as well. They [...]

d454	The message from the Kremlin so far has been ambiguous. President Vladimir Putin has made much of his newfound friendship with Bush and has reined in the sort of bellicose, anti-American rhetoric that erupted in 1999 with the war against Serbs in Kosovo. But Putin tends carefully to Russian economic interests, and his government has confirmed that it will soon sign a long-term, $40 billion economic cooperation agreement with Iraq covering such areas as energy and transportation. The Kremlin's haziness may signal an interest in striking a deal. Key political and corporate figures in both Washington and Moscow [...]

It was claimed that on some occasions he would drive himself in a Ford Sierra to the pre-arranged meets. Andrew Thomas, prosecuting, claimed the boy was willingly working with a gang dealing in hard drugs in Rhyl, North Wales. But the youth, who denies eight charges of supply, said he had been kidnapped, beaten up and forced to sell the drugs for others, whom he refused to name. Mold Crown Court yesterday heard how the boy, now 15, would be contacted on a mobile phone to [...]

d461	In addition, the trunk of the body is often inclined significantly forward in a two legged squat but remains nearly vertical in a one-leg effort, so the latter more closely parallels the form required for running. Plus, for purposes of maintaining balance, the feet are often angled outward during the two-leg squat, which is unnatural to running, while the feet point straight a head during a one-leg effort. Overall, the one leg squat has the added advantage of being safer, since less total weight is used. The first exercise, the high bench step up, is like climbing hills in the comfort of your own home or gym. You are basically lifting your body repeatedly against the force of gravity and powering your hamstrings, quads, and gluteals in the process. Like hill workouts, the step up should [...]
d462	While tradition is important, if evangelicals/protestants thought it was the ultimate authority then the reformation would never have occurred. The second weakness of their presentation was that their Bible overview had virtually nothing that contradicted the other two views. The verses basically all supported the concept that God performed special creation (something the other two views agree with).The Day-Age view based most of their arguments on how well scientific discoveries correlate with the sequence of events in Genesis 1. The science presented was very convincing. Unfortunately, neither of the other 2 teams had the knowledge or inclination to dialog on any of those issues (other than a few feeble attempts to [...]

Rather less well known than George Gissing is his younger brother, Algernon Gissing (1860-1937).

First, in the better world (of the Kingdom of Heaven, or the communist society), religion no longer exists as a separate institution and sphere of life because its task in that role has been completed. Instead, all of life becomes a sacred continuum . God is scattered into everyone, and politically, monarchy is replaced by democracy. All hierarchy and [...]

Ideally, online and in-store operations will have their own respective approaches to pricing, given differences in the cost to serve each channel, but near-total price transparency means that consumers will be quick to pick up on pricing disparities.

d473	We intend to use corrective feedback by allowing the speaker of a language game to provide the hearer with the correct reference of an expression if the language game was unsuccessful, e.g., by means of pointing at the intended target. It is unclear to what extent children receive corrective feedback on erronous use of word-meaning mappings. However, it is clear that like in adult-adult communication ( Clark 1996 ), participants of adult-child communication carefully monit or the correctness of the language use ( Chouinard & Clark 2003 ). Chouinard & Clark have argued that, although, children may not be corrected by providing them with the correct meaning of a word, they are provided with the correct word for a certain meaning. Furthermore, we believe that children are well capable of evaluating the effectiveness of a language game, and alter their hypotheses about a word's meaning when they [...]

d477	"However, his definition of ""colour strength"", the product of Munsell Value and Munsell Chroma, does not seem to be strictly true. For instance, when colours are presented on a white background, dark colours would appear to have more ""strength"" than light colours, providing that they are both at the same chroma level. This disagrees with the above equation, which indicates that dark colours always have less ""strength"" than bright colours. A different definition of ""colour strength"" was proposed by Moon and Spencer that ""colour strength"" was determined by the scalar moment of the colour in question about an adaptation point in a uniform colour space. Similar to Ostwald's ring star , Munsell's practical principles of colour harmony are based on the idea that [...]"

""How can we best ensure that the specialty adapts to secure its future? and ""How can we ensure that it works mainly to promote better care of older people rather than simply to perpetuate itself? A fascination of the evening would be to see how the four protagonists [...]"
d492	An x-ray can also be helpful in showing calcification in the joint cartilage (this is obvious in most cases of pseudogout) or in the tendon (calcific tendinitis). Occasionally a repeat x-ray is taken a few weeks later and may show that the calcification in the cartilage or tendon has decreased. This is because the crystals have been shed and dispersed. Blood tests are often taken during the attack to assess the level of inflammation and to check that the problem is not caused by an infection. If you develop pseudogout and are younger than most people who [...]
d493	BT speaks with forked tongue (29 June 1999) BT has finally said something about something. In fact, it has said two things about something. On Thursday a very senior employee told a meeting that BT would start to offer broadband services over its local loop in August 1999; then a report in the Sunday Times said it would not do so unless it was given exclusive rights by OFTEL to develop such services for three years. So, if this suggestion was accepted, until 2002 nobody else would be allowed to run broadband services over BT's local loop. This would allow BT to [...]
d494	"Typical verbal messages include the following: ""You were lying on the table and it felt like........what did it feel like?; ""Yes, this body""; ""This arm. The manner of recall is essential for evoking the feeling. Neither the practitioner nor the receiver asks with emphasis or force, but casually, almost indifferently, with a kind of idle curiosity which bypasses the conscious thinking mind. The receiver then can use recall at any and all times to reproduce the better feeling in a specific body part. Furthermore, [...]"

d496	Bedfordshire Biggleswade, in Bedfordshire, has come under great pressure from the FBU to go on strike, but continued working. During the first strike there were over 30 FBU pickets, which the law sees as intimidatory rather than persuasion, which should only involve 6 pickets. The retained personnel were prevented from getting onto their station to record their availability, and went to meet at their local pub. They were followed by a FBU delegation who gave them a mouthful. When rebuffed they arranged to [...]

d503	The need for opening up discourse on difference, cultural diversity and race in university classrooms Teacher education has a major role in opening up discourse around difference, cultural diversity and issues associated with multiculturalism, immigration and racism. If student teachers lack familiarity with non-mainstream groups they must be challenged to consider the 'other' dimension or they may perpetuate prejudicial perspectives in their professional practices in the future. By starting with more familiar aspects of difference such as gender and class, and 'cultural groups' such as persons with disabilities, the elderly and gay people, students may begin to explore issues associated with diversity and difference, and to develop some empathy before they make links with racial injustice and inequity (eg. Epstein, 1993). With the particular student cohort in this study gender and social class may have been excellent vehicles for understanding diversity because it is grounded in the experiences of a largely female group, where a significant proportion have also worked their way up from working class origins through 'educational opportunities'. The significance of challenging racist views Teacher education must be regarded as an important site for examining social justice and equity issues and attitudes and beliefs concerning multiculturalism and racism. Although most student teachers may have learnt that it is no longer socially acceptable to [...]

The top three rhymes will be made into a short animated film, to be screened later this year. The scheme is being backed by the children's author Michael Rosen - though he defends our grisly literary history. Dinah Morley, the deputy director of children's mental health charity Young Minds, believes that we learn nursery rhymes at such a young age and in such a manner that they have little potential for harm.

d506	In 1995 the principals' association divided into two sub groups, one for primary and one for secondary. The newer principals sometimes expressed irritation engendered by attendance at meetings where 'the old guard' had a tendency to blame everyone else for their problems. A predilection to 'moan' and frequent lack of focus were also cited as reasons for dissatisfaction with principals' meetings. At the same time members of the groups did acknowledge that there had been a need to 'get things off their chest' but they believed that, having done this, the time had come to 'tip the agenda towards matters of policy and structure'. From late 1995 onwards principals [...]
d507	Access to information on the Internet The Internet has taken the power away from the TV producers to control access to information. For many years in the UK the BBC and ITV controlled the television mass media and were able to promote the acceptance of evolution unhindered with multi-million pound budgets full of beautiful scenery and animals, although overlaid with an evolutionary narrative. Creationists simply could not compete with such levels of spending and exposure, and those who supported special creation were sidelined. But it would seem that many people have not been taken in by the media brainwashing. The other main driver that is [...]
d508	The president argued that scientists could use the 60 stem-cell lines available as of 9 August 2001, but that federal funding would no longer be provided to develop new lines from human embryos or to conduct work on any new lines developed elsewhere. Mooney points out that this compromise left scientists with very little material for research, actually far fewer than even the 60 lines promised. But what Mooney fails to note is that several prominent scientists lined up behind Bush to congratulate him for his courage, and that major scientific bodies, including the American Society for Cell Biology and the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology, issued statements of support. Mooney is right when he says that Republicans are using science to advance moral arguments that they are otherwise failing to win. Republicans have, for example, deliberately [...]

Interpretive Review The baseline studies inform the research at a practical level, but also at a conceptual level.

Interpretive review is an important aspect of the research method. As [...]
d510	Although very young, the only person who regarded himself as a 'boy' was the boy himself - who was amazed to find he was treated with such respect by his elders - but in spite of this he still only received one shilling (5p) per week and was only allowed ashore on Saturday and Sunday afternoons! The boy seamen were treated like adults and were regarded as being capable of doing the same tasks as anyone else on the ship. They became specialists; they were courageous, well-educated seamen who were respected by the rest of the ship's crew - they also became energetic and disciplined Nigerians. The situation they found themselves in forced them to grow up quickly and in the early days of their naval service they soon encountered the harsh realities of war, seeing starving Russians bombed almost to destruction, and the hardships of enemies who were suffering even more than they were. I can still vividly [...]
d511	Foster turned well to get a shot on target, but was annoyed to see his effort blocked once more by a resiliant Olney defence. Olney spurred on by the fact that they could still get back into the game, mounted more attacks but between John Hughes in goal and Tom Sharp in the centre of the Wellingborough defence, crosses were kept out with ease. The 90 minutes was now up and the concensus of opinion was that there would be about 4 minutes of Injury Time to play. Olney continued to pressure and created a few scary moments for the home side. Wellingborough's defence was holding out and after about 5 minutes of injury time had elapsed, the ball was pumped long up the field and Olney's keeper came off his line and sliced his clearance [...]
d512	"Moon and Spencer's Model P. Moon and D. E. Spencer proposed a quantitative model of colour harmony, using predictors ""colour interval"" (i.e. colour difference), area factor and an aesthetic measure (Moon and Spencer, 1944a-1944c). Their work has attracted considerable attention, although the model was found to have poor predictive performance (Pope, 1944; Granger, 1953, 1955a-b; Sivik and Hård, 1994). Nevertheless, Moon and Spencer's effort was still important in the research of colour harmony. Granger (1955c) wrote, ""in spite of the disappointing results obtained with the existing form of Moon and Spencer's aesthetic measure, the general quantitative approach which they adopt is to be welcomed in a field which for so long has been characterised by unchecked qualitative speculation. Moon and Spencer believed that [...]"

A remarkable property of waves is that they can pass through one another without being disturbed. While they are passing through, the resulting acoustic pressure is always just the sum of the acoustic pressures of each individual wave at that moment and location. The following [...]

'Crincum-Crancum' is, relatively speaking, a near-musical concoction created (I guess, wildly) by switching between tracks at the mixing desk: we jump from whirrs to banging to feedback, and more besides, the elements almost conspiring to build a strange mixed chord shape (although no Rosedale chord organ from Woolworths could perform like this!)

d518	While the two always had a fierce attachment, by turns intimate and tumultuous, decades of fractious and contentious and frustrating interactions found a reprieve after the birth of Catherine's daughter, Olive. Witty and direct, weaving back and forth in time, the book charts the transformation of this volatile and unique mother-daughter relationship from longing to connection. A book about love, mortality, and the nature of family bonds, 'It Hit Me Like A Ton of Bricks' is a must-read for anyone trying to navigate their way through the distance between their fantasies of love and the realities of family relationships. Reviews 'It Hit Me Like a Ton of Bricks' is written with such disarming honesty that it would be uncomfortably unsettling if it weren't tempered by equal doses of stunning wit. The [...]

There are many other substances that cause dependency - the most important is nicotine, this kills millions of people every year. Other substances that cause dependency are drugs like heroin or cocaine. Only about one third of people with alcohol dependency will develop liver disease - there is probably a separate set of genes that determines this. This is a really important piece of information, because every person with alcohol dependency will have had drinking partners who perhaps have drunk more for longer but may never [...]

The serious formulation of the neoconservatives' argument says that while the United States acts on moral realism, the West Europeans have adopted an idealistic view of international affairs that may be appropriate in dealing with the concerns of the European community but is irresponsible as an approach to an international order threatened by rogue states and anarchic failed states.

I had hoped that by the time I got to the grand old age I am now (52) that black people would have stopped constantly begging white people to do things for us.

It's also a land in transition, home both to children sequestered from birth and a world-renowned teenage film director.

In Glastonbury town or parts of India favoured by idiots you can become wise by wrapping your balls up with a chain and decorating yourself like a Christmas tree.

A poll of opinion amongst PIMA member firms had led to a response from some 60 member firms of whom about 53% would favour a change (for PEPs) to the flat-rate 20% deduction. This however, did not represent an overwhelming majority in favour of change and, in view of the requirement to make software changes should the 20% be adopted for PEPs, it is not anticipated that the Inland Revenue will change the status quo on this point.

Renoir masterfully created Luncheon of the Boating Party 's mood of enchantment by capturing both the immediacy and specificity of a moment of leisure on the Seine and the universal appeal of human celebration.

d557	The growth in demand for equal educational rights inevitably strengthens the desire for the development of each teacher's skills for meeting the individual needs of all learners. With a new concentration upon the needs of students with SEN and their transitions, there seems to be some uncertainty with regards to what the development of these skills might mean for teacher education (Mittler 2000). Therefore, in this paper we intend to focus on transitions from the point of view of learners having special educational needs but also by considering the challenges transitions bring for development of teachers' skills. However, our aim is not so much in considering this as a universal issue but instead do it through raising experiences of promoting this in one practical initiative taken within the Baltic countries. For a starting point we will provide some description of this initiative to enable the reader to understand the context in which the forthcoming [...]

In addition, Order 81 allows plant breeders to claim ownership of old varieties (and to call them new"" varieties) if they are the first to describe or characterize them. They can then also claim ownership of related crops that are ""not clearly distinguishable from the protected varieties"". The control of all protected varieties will last 20 years for field crops and 25 years for trees and vines. Farmers who save seed or otherwise [...]"
d559	None of us had ever seen this sort of treatment given to any of our servicemen before, but the Japs just accepted it and got on with their work. I was immediately aware that if they'd do this to their own, then there was no point in any of us complaining because we'd obviously receive worse treatment. I admit that initially, I felt sorry for this soldier after seeing his public humiliation, but it was the last time I ever felt any compassion towards any of them. All of us in years to come would receive beatings far in excess of this spectacle on our first day of captivity. It was to become a way of life and sadly, some would receive one beating too many, and never [...]

He said his mother read it from Idaho. With issues of African-Americans accounting for disproportional imprisonment, unfair sentencing and profiling, police brutality, lack of representation in broad media, and other issues, it should be expected that Seattle's mainstream media would have resisted any attempts to discredit our community and those who have served it well.

Competition plays mean, nasty corporations off against each other in a contest to serve us. Yes, they still have power, but its negative effects are lessened. It is when corporations can use the state to rig the rules in their favor that the negative effects of their power become magnified, precisely because it has the force of the state behind it.

d564	So we are presented with the bizarre and bewildering spectacle of American planes dropping explosives and food on Afghanistan at the same time. Refugees to whom the West turned a blind eye a few weeks ago are now pushed to the top of the global agenda, as a kind of human shield behind which war can legitimately be waged. Meanwhile, cruise missiles and aid packages are deployed as two different kinds of weapon with the same aim. What began as Bush's 'crusade' against a threat that many in the West tried to compare to the Nazis, has ended up in a bombing campaign against one of the most wretched countries on Earth where, US officials concede, there is almost nothing worth bombing.

It is clear that in its attempts to reveal the truth about human rights violation, deep wounds were reopened and the process seemed to lead to anger and frustration rather than to a feeling of reconciliation.

Crime has worsened and along with it, disillusionment and hopelessness among black and coloured citizens and increasing fear and flight in the white community. I [...]

Women with higher alcohol consumption also tended to smoke more in cases and controls. Only 37% of women who never drank alcohol had ever smoked, a proportion rising to about 70% in those with the highest alcohol intake. In women who had never drunk alcohol (22,000 cases and 41,000 controls) there was no relationship between breast cancer and smoking history (relative risk 1.03). Because of the relationship between increased alcohol consumption and increased smoking, no reliable information could be drawn for smokers who also [...]

First, abolish the remainder of the $190bn (¬£100.4bn) in extra loans ludicrously awarded to farmers who are already subsidised up to the gills. Second, phase out the $3.9bn a year farmers get, equivalent to $230 an acre, to grow uneconomic cotton that could be grown more effectively in developing countries (thereby generating extra income for poor countries to buy international goods). Third, rescind tax cuts for the rich. They are bad in themselves and don't do much to [...]

For example, in 1999 an estimated 860,000 African children lost their teachers to AIDS.

Presidential budget proposals are aspirational documents, not things that become law, and the congressional budget process is governed by the Congressional Budget Office's scores anyway, not by whatever OMB cooks up.

One clear headline value of the Trump budget is an overwhelming preference for cutting taxes on high-income families over providing food, medical care, housing assistance, and other support to low-income families.

d575	A trial from South Africa found that avoidance of meat anddairy, and not the presence of fibre, appears to be primarily responsible for a low risk of colon cancer. As a result of these negative findings some researchers and doctors have begun to question the idea that insoluble fibre protects against colon cancer, a concept that had arisen from a large body of older research. Fibre also fills the stomach, reducing appetite. In theory, fibre should therefore reduce eating, leading to weight loss . However, at least some research has found increased fibre to have no effect on body weight despite [...]

Production leapt by 41 per cent on 2000, giving Marlborough over half (52 per cent) of the total national grape crop. Summer was exceptionally dry, with an all-time December-February low of 27.2 mm of rain (compared to the long-term average of 145 mm.)

d592	The texts copied in the Auchinleck MS give us a useful snapshot of the kind of language to be found in the London area in the generations before Chaucer. As might have been expected, the language of Sir Orfeo is slightly more old-fashioned than that found in the best Chaucerian MSS. Thus it will, for instance, be observed that there are two forms for SHE in the following passage, sche and hye. More subtly, analysis of the various occurrences of this pronoun in the MS indicates that sche is used when the pronoun is at the beginning of the clause containing it, whereas the older (and less distinctive) form hye occurs when the pronoun appears after the verb it governs, eg. Hir riche robe hye al torett ( she tore asunder her noble garment). This systematic [...]

Some shave their heads, others shave their faces, some open fetes or start boat races, some say they help the sick, the poor, the dying, but all the time, they deceive, connive, they are lying.

We consider the present and past attempts to deal with the debt crisis to be absolutely insufficient, and we oppose the existing debt relief framework, developed and controlled by creditors and designed to function only in their interests. Africa Action opposes conditionalities imposed by Northern creditors which perpetuate a global economic system where Africa remains economically controlled by the developed world. We believe that the costs of debt cancellation should be borne by the creditor nations and the International Financial Institutions, and moreover, we believe that the global North owes Africa an historical debt for centuries of exploiting the continent's human and natural resources.

d598	While ISPs and consumers in more advanced economies are also affected by spam, those countries' network providers spend proportionately less in fighting junk e-mail from marketers and scammers, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said in a recent report. In terms of a percentage of a developing country's ISP's budget, much more is spent on hardware, bandwidth and software licenses, so additional spam-fighting resources hits those ISPs hardest, the Paris-based group said. From the consumer perspective, money is wasted in downloading spam, since many ISPs in developing nations charge by the minute for dial-up access. Internet users in many of these countries still rely on narrowband access at home, or shared access at cyber cafes, where connections are slow and users pay by the byte of data downloaded. To [...]

Babies deliver lower pay and prospects From the moment they give birth, women get stuck on a 'mummy track' of low pay and low prospects as their wages fall and never fully recover - even when their children have left home, a new study has found. The effect continues when children start school, leading to another sudden slump in the average growth of women's pay compared with male wages, according to the report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.

d615	Britain's insistence that high commissioners did not represent 'foreign' states and should therefore be treated differently from ambassadors lingered on. Thus, the flags on their official cars were distinct from those of the diplomatic corps. Despite the objections raised in 1948, Britain regarded ambassadors and high commissioners as separate, but equal, groups and 'interleaved' them at functions where both were represented. She also put much effort into protecting the distinctive office of high commissioner during the negotiation of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations which, as a result of a Ghanaian proposal, protects the office by referring to ambassadors <91>and other heads of mission of equivalent rank'.

d619	It is as a native that he accepts the River God, and it is the subjection of Man that gives to Man his dignity. For without some kind of God, Man is not even very interesting. So accustomed to using Conrad's eyes, Eliot is able to see through Twain's the native emotion of his own nativity and childhood in the nursery bedroom, seeing that childhood in terms of a fundamental primitivism from which his religious consciousness has grown. Here again, anthropology and romanticism have coalesced. The experience represented by river and sea is the experience of tradition's endurance, and a tradition, even in its full development, has no truck with 'superficial notions of evolution [as] a means of [...]
d620	In the last five years, the GCSE pass rate in his classes has increased from 64% to 94%, a substantial achievement in itself. Anna has been teaching at St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Stourbridge for two years, having finished her three year QTS Advanced Early Years degree in 2000. The judges from the Teacher of the Year Awards were struck by her enthusiasm and teaching skills. Faced with some challenging pupils in her class, Anna was able to help them overcome emotional and learning difficulties, improving the class as a whole. She is also heavily involved in extra curricular activities, from running the netball team to [...]
d621	"A third statement would be: Is it a problem of remembering or is it a problem of speaking out the victims truth? A problem of breaking down silence and getting back the victim's dignity?. I would like to make a last set of questions: Is remembering an end point or is it the beginning of a real reconciliation and peace construction process?. I should quote Monsignor Gerardi's words: ""knowing the truth may be painful, but it is without any doubt, highly healthy and liberating"". Repression took away the people's right to speak and [...]"
d622	Cautionary note for the reader: 'Crystal meth', the drug at the heart of the movie, is one of the nicknames for 'methamphetamine'. It is a very powerful nervous system stimulant which can be readily synthesised in small labs from cheap, over the counter chemicals. It is known by many names including 'speed', 'ice', 'glass', 'meth' and 'crank'. The drug can be snorted, smoked, injected or swallowed. Methamphetamines increase activity, decrease appetite and the induced high can last up to 8 hours. The pain tends to [...]
d623	"""It is a difficult thing to meet all that is required federally while also trying to provide what is needed for students locally."" Meanwhile, Hannigan Machado continues her big push to get academic and CTE teachers to collaborate closely in order to find new ways of engaging students, especially struggling learners. ""We're asking teachers more and more to work together on projects, so they can complement each other, provide more opportunities for students to connect with what's being taught,"" she said. Michelle Strout, Manchester School of Technology business teacher, teaches a freshman soft skills class.

d624	"The words ""silence"", ""strange"" and stagnant"" feature regularly especially in the initial poems. This is not accidental, as a close reading shows their operational significance. They serve to highlight surprise and the initial inability to do anything as reality sinks in. But it is not a situation that lasts for long because the indomitable human spirit takes over and the battle of survival is engaged in every facet of life. Today I live among cocoyam groves wayfarer in search of seeds of truth But still, I [...]"
d625	I even fashioned a pocket-size 'sonic screwdriver' by rigging up some bulbs, batteries and wire, though the curious contraption created such a bulge in mytrousers it looked obscene. There was also the health and safety aspect of a homemade electrical appliance left unattended in such a delicate area. As the years passed by, however, I grew weary of Dr Who and his low-budget battles with wobbly, blobby aliens and tinfoil galactic commanders. Sci-fi in the cinema was becoming more sophisticated and impressive, leaving the dated Doctor eternally locked in his own quaint TV timewarp. Perhaps I was merely a fairweather fan, for I'd already deserted the show by the time Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy took turns at attempting to [...]
d626	He acts with charismatic authority. Charismatic authorities are always a bother to established authorities, as we have seen, but they appear from time to time.

d628	"I've been head-composing a post about Ruth Kelly for a while, but Butterflies and Wheels puts it far better than anything I came up with: It's a bit like belonging to a Nazi party, or the KKK, or the God Hates Fags gang, and then trying to claim not only that of course one's belonging to that organization doesn't in the least mean one can't ""speak up"" for the rights of Jews or blacks or gays, why on earth would it, but also that even asking the question is absurd and outrageous and indignation-worthy. It's a bit like that, but to many observers it doesn't look like that, because we've been so relentlessly trained to think of religious beliefs and teachings as in some profound way entirely different from political beliefs. But why would they be? Because it's taboo to challenge them, that's why - and that's a terrible reason. If someone said ""I personally want to let children set fire to their teachers, but I won't let that [...]"
d629	Such performances are described by that orchestra in the record booklet as bringing 'the new forms of expression of the 21st century to bear on them [the symphonies]' - by which they actually mean many of the insights of the early music movement for so long rejected out of hand by the Vienna Philharmonic. The tradition is being gradually modified and re-invented. Now, as we know in all our own fields, when there are huge challenges to an accepted tradition you can do several things. You can put your head in the sand and pretend it's not happening. You can joyfully [...]
d630	His own nature coming to the fore, Googluupo shot the man twice, in the head, with the pistol. It was done without thought, just like he had killed most of his own people -- and got into that fix in the first place. He had to stop, shaking like a Eklllee, as Allen, with increased energy, tried to escape and take control. There was no such thing as remorse. Googluupo couldn't have know what the word meant, nor [...]
d631	We also learn by making mistakes and reflecting on what those mistakes were and what we can do about them. Learning by doing, works. Learning by telling, doesn't. In e-learning this means using case-based instruction, emotional impact, video, role-playing, storytelling. Learners are put into situations that seem realistic to them, to [...]
d632	When this was made known, there seemed to be a general smile of congratulation at the number fallen, rather than of their regret for their loss. The vanity of the officers seemed tickled at the disproportionate slaughter in a frigate of our size, as compared to what they had heard the ships of the line had suffered. I attended the surgeon in the steerage, to which place the wounded were removed, and saw all the amputations performed, without flinching; when men who had behaved well in the action fainted at the sight. I am afraid I almost took a pleasure in observing the operations of the surgeon, without once reflecting on the pain suffered by the patient. Habit had now begun to [...]
d633	A huge revolution was taking place during the nineteenth century. It is summed up in the way Hegel brought all philosophy down into history, and his successors began to describe a new and radical version of humanism. Human reason, human language, and, in short, all thinking is brought down into the unfolding temporal process. Philosophical attention becomes more and more concentrated on history and the here and now. The old timeless, invisible world disappears and the soul/body [...]
d634	Certainly his wisdom is sorely missed. NHSCA has always maintained its independence and stance of not being aligned to any political party. Nor would we suggest to members how they should vote; it would in any case be more than usually difficult on this occasion. The Executive Committee is however working on a form of 'manifesto', indicating the sort of policies and priorities we would wish the next government to follow and we hope to have that displayed on our website and publicised in other ways before the Election comes. This event failed to [...]
d635	 The mountainous grey and black magma, shaped by volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, is offset by the bright white flat-roofed buildings of the modern town. Lindos was discovered by hippies in the 1970s, who turned it into a kind of Berkeley-by-Aegean - they were soon followed by the British holiday industry, and today Lindos is a slightly upmarket package tour destination. The town has mostly weathered this well, not least because the streets are so narrow that no cars are allowed in, only motorbikes and donkeys. Many of the older buildings have been turned into bars and restaurants, the newer buildings into studio apartments (there are no hotels in the town, thanks to the Greek Ministry of Culture declaring it a national heritage site) and so increasingly the local people have moved out into the surrounding villages. The busy tourist trade [...]
d636	"Hunting is one of the activities listed likely to cause damage to an SSSI. The two hunts are of no importance to the local economy. In fact they are a drain on Forest resources in that they pay no fees unlike other riders and yet cause erosion to forest lands.Since they are not restricted to the Rides, as all other riders are, both these factors cause ill feeling and resentment. In fact hunting on Ashdown Forest is positively detrimental to the rural economy. The forest was the source of inspiration for AA Milnes ""Winnie the Pooh"" stories and as a result attracts many visitors from outside the county and from overseas (totalling in excess of 1.25 million per annum). The Ashdown Forest Wildlife Protection Group has in the past obtained video evidence of the Old Surrey and Burstow hunt causing distress to children visiting Pooh Bridge and of a Master of that hunt [...]"
d637	"The upcoming agreement -- called a ""memorandum of understanding"" -- helped derail a tougher discharge ban proposed by Democratic lawmakers earlier this year after the Norwegian Sun dumped 40 tons of human waste into the Strait of Juan de Fuca in May. Cruise lines opposed the bill, and Ecology officials said it might disrupt a process that would provide protections this year. Critics, however, denounced the agreement as toothless. It's ""worse than nothing because it provides a false sense of protection,"" said Fred Felleman of Ocean Advocates in Seattle. The fact that there is no consequence to [...]"

d639	"Timothy 5:17 in the RSV Bible tells us that God ""richly furnishes us with everything to enjoy"". It would appear that He approves of pleasure. This makes perfect sense considering that it was He who designed us with the capacity to enjoy pleasure in the first place. This sometimes seems to have been lost on certain self-appointed guardians of evangelical morality. These are the people who will tell you things not specifically prohibited in the Scriptures ought to be. Three examples might be the practices of smoking, [...]"

She had a daughter, Joely, (now 30 and an award-winning actress living in Vancouver), whom he adopted when he married Andrea in 1975. They had a son, Simon (now a record producer in Frankfurt), but the marriage ended in an acrimonious divorce five years later. He accused her of [...]
d642	"There's nothing wrong with lists - just some (too many) Munro twitchers. Michael Marra, Newtyle, songwriter Fats Waller described himself as the world's greatest piano player at seventeen stone. This Munro thing makes me think about the ""ploughman's lunch"" which people will tell you consists of bread and cheese and a bit of onion or that, when in fact it's an advertising slogan thought up in the sixties to encourage people to eat in pubs. If there is not an happy Eater (sic - Ed.) being thrown up (sick - Ed.) beneath each new Munro as I write, I'll eat my ball of clava. I wouldn't cross the street to hear an orchestra of ginger haired men, I'd rather sit on a well placed pavement and [...]"

d645	Designs tended to be symmetrical and much use was made of enclosing medallions. Animals and 'birds and even floral motifs were frequently presented 'heraldically', that is in pairs, either confronted or back to back. Some motifs, such as the Tree of Life, have an ancient history in the Near East; others, like the dragon and winged horse, reveal the constant love affair of Asiatic art with the mythical. Sassanian art was carried over an immense territory stretching from the Far East to the shores of the Atlantic and played a foremost role in the formation of both European and Asiatic medieval art. Islamic art however, was the true heir to Sassanian art, whose concepts it was to assimilate while, at the same time [...]

Seconds later, as Jack stared at the pit, Mays scrambled up out of the tunnel entrance, closely followed by Daniel and Teal'c, all of them coughing and coated with dirt. Well, that was close,"" Daniel said casually as he coughed again, trying to clear the dust from his throat. Jack just shook his head and looked at Mays, who [...]"
d647	Possessiveness in all its forms leads to a life of limitation. For example, if one covets the love of someone but instead of winning the love of that person loses it to another, there ensues a narrowing down and strangling of the free life of the spirit -- and one has an acute consciousness of limitation. This is the origin of the pain of suffocating jealousy. But if one looks at the situation with a heart purged of longing, the love that is received by the other will be seen in its natural beauty. In the clarity of perception that comes through nonpossessiveness, one [...]
d648	However, the bacteria reproduce to high numbers in warm, stagnant water such as that found in certain plumbing systems and hot water tanks, cooling towers and evaporative condensers of large air-conditioning systems, and whirlpool spas. Outbreaks of legionellosis have occurred after persons have breathed mists that come from a water source (e.g., air conditioning cooling towers, whirlpool spas, showers) contaminated with Legionella bacteria. Persons may be exposed to these mists in hotels, hospitals, or public places.

d651	The whole process must be logical, with lots of excitement, use of theatrical tricks like sound, lighting, music and, in the case of THE WITCHES, stage illusion. I particularly like using magic, because it takes me back to my conjuring roots! Some plays can patronise children -- how do you get round this? By telling the story honestly and excitingly, and never underestimating children's ability to understand. Most children, if the [...]

d653	On the right, Smith's feint had failed. It seemed that the battle might be lost, especially as the fighting was so intense and the casualties were so high. Both of the officers, who were carrying the Colours of the 31st, had been killed and at the crucial moment of defeat, Sergeant Bernard McCabe picked up the Regimental Colour. Under intense fire, he climbed to the highest point of the enemy earthworks and planted the Colour for all to see. This [...]

The exhibitors are drawn from a range of photographic backgrounds. Addressing diverse contemporary and social issues, the group has deconstructed the great themes of photography. Using a range of different presentation techniques, the Lightgeist artists aim to establish a dialogue with the viewer, [...]
d655	The pressure group Living Streets (see page 5) researched the needs of older and disabled Londoners and found that more than half of survey respondents walk to the post office. Doubtless a similar survey in Birmingham would find the same thing. But there is another argument too; these are facilities owned by the public, they are important, and they must stay. In the case of Cheapside, the proposal is to close the branch and promote the one at 174 Stratford Road (Sparkbrook) or the branch at Gooch Street. This is hardly a good start to plans to [...]
d656	Nevertheless, this awesome description of the brown dwarf appears in the same text as the description of its celestial heavenly passage noted above. This is clearly no ordinary planet. It seems surrounded by nets, halos, cloak, lightning and flames, and this imagery described its appearance prior to the impact of one of its moons with Tiamat, ruling out these references as being explosions. They are clearly descriptions of Nibiru's actual appearance, although possibly in an excited state. If one thinks of the corona that one sees around the Sun during a total eclipse, one can begin to [...]
d657	"The end result has been a tightly controlled oligopolistic market, in which the conglomerates have a practically monopolistic access to the global distribution networks. On top of this, they have at hand the possibility of using their multiple outlets for cross-promotion, effectively eschewing competition as it is theoretically understood. Especially, though not exclusively, American companies came out on top in this ""urge-to-merge"" - the long-standing commercial nature of the American Broadcasting meant that they had a head start and a foothold in the profitable US market (ibid). But while the American market is still the biggest in the world, and one any conglomerate must penetrate in order to secure their standing in and amongst the oligopoly, the conglomerates are now looking elsewhere to maximise their profits [...]"
d658	A total of 13 speakers talked on issues ranging from action at the local level, research projects in Wales, generic talks on bats and cetaceans and a number of species specific talks on many different types of mammals found in Wales. It was impossible to cover all the mammal species that we have and the programme tried to reflect areas where there is a lot of work being undertaken or particular current issues. As broad a range of species as possible were covered to give a flavour of the current distribution and abundance and an idea of the current situation regarding conservation work and research. It is hoped that in the future we will be able to look at some of the other species not included this time. Some of the Wales Mammal Group organising team The conference also aimed to get people together to [...]

d661	Back in Belfast, the Protestant paramilitaries used this document as the basis for their first political deliberations. Andy Tyrie, as commander of the UDA, was another of the key men at the centre of the stoppage. His plump unathletic appearance topped by glasses and a moustache disguised the ruthlessness and singlemindedness required to rise to the top of a large paramilitary organisation like the UDA, whose membership at the time was estimated at about 6,000. When Tyrie took over the position he reorganised by centralising control to a much greater degree and imposing tighter discipline. When he had accomplished this, he investigated the possibility of [...]

d665	Is Chalabi just a crooked US stooge? Few foreign figures so polarise the Bush administration, but Ahmed Chalabi, leader of the most visible exile opposition group before the war, is likely to have a big influence over the government that emerges. Mr Chalabi, who previously left Jordan before a conviction for major fraud, insists from his headquarters in Nasiriyah that he has no intention of taking a leading political role in Iraq. Yet Mr Chalabi - after devoting two decades to opposing Saddam, and claiming to have survived nine assassination attempts - is thought unlikely to bow out gracefully. The CIA, with the State Department, his prime foe, recently [...]
d666	As always, it is the innocent who suffer most. In the early 1990s there has been a succession of refugee crises as people have fled from conflicts: in 1992 alone over 3.5 million people were forced to flee across an international border. In the former Yugoslavia the number of people dependent on humanitarian assistance rose from 500,000 to 3.6 million in the sixteen months between December 1991 and June 1993. In 1992 over 10% of the population of Somalia were refugees in neighbouring countries. By the end of 1992 the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia created more than 800,000 refugees, while the civil [...]

d668	"However, the eventual horror of it all, by the end of the Second World War, then gave rise to a rediscovery of a sense of natural law - namely that some things are so immoral there can be no arguments for them. Such an ethical consciousness is hinted at in Romans 2.14-15. And Christians were in the fore in this rediscovery which then gave rise to the UN Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 and, very significantly, the Medical Code of Ethics, the Declaration of Geneva, from the second General Assembly of the World Medical Association in 1948. This required the new doctor to say: ""I solemnly pledge myself to consecrate my life to the service of humanity ... I [...]"

d674	The faded frescoes in the chapel at Grotta Ferrata leave us a memory the more of man's effort to dream beautifully; and they thus mingle harmoniously enough with our multifold impressions of Italy, where dreams and realities have both kept such pace and so strangely diverged. It was absurd--that was the truth--to be critical at all among the appealing old Italianisms round me and to treat the poor exploded Bolognese more harshly than, when I walked back to Frascati, I treated the charming old water-works of the Villa Aldobrandini. I confound these various products of antiquated art in a genial absolution, and should like especially to tell how fine it was to watch this prodigious fountain come tumbling down its channel of mouldy rock-work, through its magnificent vista of ilex, to the fantastic old hemicycle where a dozen tritons and naiads sit posturing to receive it. The sky above the ilexes was incredibly blue and the ilexes themselves incredibly black; and to see the young white [...]
d675	It is largely being observed and there appears to be widespread support, even amongst smokers, for the ban. However, some pub owners have reported a drop in sales but how long this drop in sales will last is anyone's guess. The decision therefore to bring in a partial ban in England has drawn different responses. Many agree with such restrictions; the evidence about the effects of passive smoking on those who have to work in smoke filled environments is fairly conclusive - it is not good for you! But the fears that business will be affected are [...]

Tutors gave students clear guidance on how to proceed and improve, and were supportive while encouraging students to develop their capacity for independent work. Seminars were more varied in quality. Among the characteristics of those judged to be excellent were clear aims and objectives; well-structured sessions, with good time management; high expectations of students; a challenging, lively and critical approach to the subject; a fast but suitable pace; well-prepared and attentive students, and frequent contributions by students. In some seminars, groups were skilfully sub-divided in order to [...]

Would more money be available if the principle purpose of a grant were to shore up Government policy in the fight against 'terrorism'? The media failed to [...]

On Wednesday, foreign policy analyst Max Boot, whose work I generally admire, penned a truly awful piece for Foreign Policy magazine. The piece had nothing to do with foreign policy, which was part of the problem - Boot's analysis of domestic policy simply isn't up to the same standard as his books, virtually all of which are worth a read. More than that, the piece was an evidence-free piece of fluff guaranteed to make members of the political Left feel warm and fuzzy without providing any support to Boot's main contention: that America is still dominated by white privilege. Boot begins by [...]
d680	There, when they have eaten her bread and drunk her wine, they will leave folly behind and will gain wisdom and perception. The Reading and the Gospel both make God a host inviting people to eat and drink what he has provided for them. However, there is a crucial difference between this food and that given to the Israelites in the desert - and the bread and fish shared with the five thousand. These meals had definitely kept people alive - but, as evidence later in the Book of Exodus and in the Gospel we are reading at the moment suggests, it did not necessarily bring wisdom. The Israelites were still full of doubt and complaint - and many of the Jews listening to Jesus could not [...]
d681	It believes that for too long interventions have sought only to repair the damage caused by social exclusion. For many people the help comes too late to be effective in addressing the problem. Government is committed to cutting away the very roots of social exclusion and to preventing the damage happening in the first place. Tackling Social Exclusion in England, Wales and Scotland The Prime Minister has established a Social Exclusion Unit in the Cabinet Office to identify and tackle the causes of social exclusion. It will work towards new and more co-ordinated ways of [...]
d682	The CBT team carefully inspected the walls, which were subdivided geographically and chronologically and sampled by core drilling and taking individual bricks and mortar samples to try to characterise the various areas. This is not straightforward as in some of the more recent areas the mortar was clearly cement based, in the older areas, hydraulic lime based and in one area, a significant amount of brick dust was used. The hall occupies a central position in Ashton just a stones throw from the Town Hall and has clearly formed a great landmark and centrepiece to the shopping area. Parts of the building date back to 1830 with further additions in 1867, 1880 and 1930. The [...]
d683	And with the fact that it uses gas, it can be cheaper than electricity if you have a lot of clothes to dry but then again economically I just can't trust White Knight again thanks to the light plastic quality and general longevity. Thanks to Ebay, it is now possible to buy replacement doors which Crosslee must be literally cross about - priced around ¬£13 to ¬£15, it makes a lot of sense shopping around even if you aren't the most technically minded. Thanks to the manual which shows every part, it is possible to repair the machine yourself where external fittings are concerned instead of expensive pay outs and call charges. Now on its eleventh year, the White Knight is beginning to show signs of slowing down, but it hasn't died completely. We fear that the drum has started to show wear and tear signs and that noise will eventually [...]

Partly the Felt song 'Ballad of the Band', partly seeing Robbie Robertson dressed as a ringer for de Niro's young rascal Johnny Boy from Mean Streets in the Scorsese concert film The Last Waltz .

d686	Malebranche does not quite say here why he thinks things known through simple perception are impervious to the omnipotent-deceiver doubt, though his examples provide some indication. Descartes himself had said that even a malicious demon could not make him doubt his own existence, at least while he is presently attending to this question . Such doubts are self-defeating: if the demon deceives me about anything then I must exist in order to be deceived. Rather than offering an explanation of this kind, Malebranche is content here simply to report on his own psychological response to the 'extravagant supposition' of a deceiving God, which fails to [...]

Of course, you'll take your regular selection of fishing gear, but now that the water is warm, a mid-day swim provides a refreshing break that wasn't possible during the cold-water season of ice-out trolling for salmon and togue. Take your mask, fins, and snorkel so you can swim with the fish and see what they are doing; You will locate some new hotspots this way, especially for bass. And if the summer heat [...]

d691	This PDA is for the user who desires a high degree of portability but who still needs to carry around a lot of data (the 16mb RAM helps) and who wants a good quality screen. I have no trouble recommending the SJ30 as it walks all over much of the Palm OS competition in terms of memory, screen quality and battery life. The M515, T625 etc. have a very hard job competing with this. Remember- if you have been put off the NR by it's size you could always go for the SJ, an MS Camera and the MP3 attachment for not much more than an NR70V and all you would lose is the hi-res+ screen but would gain a LOT of portability. Oh yes- my wife LOVES this machine as well and I was surprised to see it [...]

How should I prepare myself physically and mentally to survive ? Don't boat when you are not 100%. You are probably already aware that rowing when you are ill, fatigued, or affected by alcohol or recreational drugs means you will not perform well.

Ideally, your petition should give the name, address and signature of each person who signs it. This will help the Council assess the extent to which the [...]
d694	Many knew, too, that the divisive system of junior and senior high schools was unusual in small Scottish towns, in most of which since the 1920s secondary education for all was given in the local high school. Plans were first prepared for a new junior high school on the Burgh School site and then for one on the Kilrymont site; but before work began on the new building a national change in educational policy took place. The practice of separating pupils at the end of their primary schooling into junior secondary and senior secondary schools had never been universally accepted. In St Andrews the example of the neighbouring towns, Anstruther and Cupar, where all pupils entered the high school at twelve was proof that an alternative system worked well and caused less distress to parents and children. However carefully pupils were assessed before the decision about their secondary school was taken mistakes were made; mistakes which were sometimes so remarkable that they [...]
d695	Epistemic insouciance is not just a posture but an affective posture. Such postures are distinguished from epistemic stances, which are policies that one can adopt or reject. Epistemic malevolence is an example of an epistemically vicious epistemic stance that issues in active attempts to undermine the knowledge possessed by a specified group of individuals. An example of epistemic malevolence in action is the so-called 'tobacco strategy.' I argue that epistemic malevolence undermines knowledge by [...]
d696	In-between the doc also provides a look at Superman through the ages via his comic book appearances, including spin-offs featuring Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane. It's certainly curious to see Superman's re-imaging over the years, up until his death and since, especially when after all the shit he's gone through comic artists have simply ended up going back to his original form, proving the point that you should never fix something that's not broken. Personally speaking I'm only familiar with the classic Superman; seeing some of the creations for the first time on this doc does generate an odd response. But nonetheless it's a nice addition that's been carefully inserted, so that the evolution of the comic books is timed nicely and fits in with the discussion of each passing decade. In addition the comic book segments [...]

d699	Because free trade expands the supply of labor competing for the world's finite supply of capital, it privileges capital relative to labor, especially when combined with capital mobility and the entry into the world trading system of large formerly-socialist nations like India and China. Problem #3: Short-Term vs. Long-Term Arguments Many arguments for free trade ignore the time dimension. For example, free traders argue that free trade is not a threat to British wages because over time, increasing prosperity in foreign countries will drive up wages overseas. This may be true (or it may not be) in the long run, but it will take a generation or more at current rates of growth. And that's presuming that the past experience of nations like Japan, which rose from poverty, will be replicated. Instead, a 'race to the bottom' could keep wages low as globalisation [...]
d700	Historian Bernard Lewis notes: For almost a thousand years ... Europe was under constant threat. In the early centuries it was a double threat - not only of invasion and conquest, but also of conversion and assimilation. All but the easternmost provinces of the Islamic realm had been taken from Christian rulers, and the vast majority of the first Muslims west of Iran and Arabia were converts from Christianity. North Africa, Egypt, Syria, even Persian-ruled Iraq, had been Christian countries, in which Christianity was older and more deeply rooted than in most of Europe. Their loss was sorely felt and heightened the fear that a similar [...]

d703	In preparing its analyses and responding to questions, the centre should be required to draw exclusively on verifiable material in the public domain, to use a clear methodology, and to employ methods of citation and corroboration of sources consistent with the highest evidentiary standards (paragraph 116) . It would be desirable if in time an independent documentation centre could be managed on an EU, if not UNHCR, basis, which would ensure that decision taken throughout the EU were based on the same country information. Such an arrangement would also reduce duplication (paragraph 117) . Prompt removal or voluntary departure of failed asylum seekers is likely to be the most effective deterrent to further unfounded applications. Failing to remove unsuccessful asylum seekers [...]
d704	The fortunes of the EEF were at a low ebb after the Transjordan raids, obliging Allenby to train his Indian replacements before resuming the offensive in the autumn of 1918. Curiously - given the amount of operational detail he includes on the Third Battle of Gaza and the Transjordan raids - Hughes makes only passing references to the Battle of Megiddo - Allenby's `masterpiece' in September 1918 - which dealt the Turks in Palestine a crushing blow and permitted Britain `to consummate the Arab revolt by placing Feisal in Damascus as ruler of Syria'. This is admittedly a book about strategy but, as Hughes has earlier been critical of Allenby's tactical and command weaknesses in late 1917 and the first half of 1918, it is unfortunate that he does not devote at least a paragraph or two to Allenby's most successful all-arms battle - in which `The Bull' was arguably at his operational peak. Hughes himself is at his best when guiding the reader through the complex web of interrelated and shifting political and strategic [...]
d705	The aging population of tankers makes routine inspection a critical issue. This inspection can be very expensive and time consuming. The sheer size of today's vessels makes this task daunting. Although there are stated guidelines set by IACS (International Association of Classification Societies, 1994), to follow when ship structures are inspected, without the knowledge of the full breadth of the problem these guidelines allow error, and in turn, possible loss of structural integrity. The growth of rusticle's may be a major [...]

Even at the age of ten, I clearly remember being tickled by the absurdness of an English seaside resort being linked with the space race. But there was more to it than that.

d710	"Money laundering,"" was a law originally meant to give drug dealers long sentences, but now it can be added to almost any tax or other kind of financial charges the government levies against a defendant. The mail fraud part of the Federal allegations is primarily to make it appear as though David Duke has misused gifts from his supporters in gambling and other disreputable activities. The effort at character assassination should be transparent to every patriot. Making these kinds of charges and allegations is the most effective way to weaken the financial support (and it is very modest) Duke needs to fund his work. If the government is able to [...]"
d711	Pastel colours are gentle and romantic, helping to restrain exuberant reds and yellows from overwhelming the senses. Save intensely blue, purple and crimson flowers for dramatic flourishes within a paler context, otherwise they will lose their impact and seem too heavy or lifeless. Set in front of a light background, these more dominating colours are not only vibrant, but suggest space and distance behind. Harmony and contrast. Planning colour schemes involves choosing and balancing [...]

By knowing what style you want ahead of time, it saves time and money on several iterations because of too few styling/design directions.

d713	The number of road accidents rises significantly when England are involved in a major football tournament, figures form Churchill Car Insurance show. And should England actually make the World Cup Final on July 9, Churchill predicts accidents on the roads could double. The company reviewed claims data from match days during the Euro 2004 soccer tournament in Portugal. These showed that road accidents increased 14% right the way through the tournament. But the accident figures really hit the roof on England match days - and as the tournament [...]
d714	This phenomenon has interfered considerably, according to some theorists, with literacy practice taking hold of the majority of Africa's people (Akoha in Olson and Torrance, 2001). In similar vein, many literacy programmes use the dominant language as a medium of instruction, as opposed to the learners' mother tongues. A considerable number of studies have revealed high failure rates in such programmes (Goody in Olson and Torrance, 2001; Lopez in Olson and Torrance, 2001; Prah in Olson and Torrance, 2001; Akoha in Olson and Torrance, 2001), though one constructivist programme that used a second language as a medium of instruction have shown excellent results (Walker, Rattanavich and Oller, 1992). These few examples indicate that literacy learning is clearly dependant on the interaction between political, socio-economic and cultural structures. It may be obvious to state that many of the [...]

In demanding that both sides of your brain are activated, you could confuse yourself and forget something - to a colleague's distress. They may feel their needs have become unimportant.

It does so in the following terms: ""This subsection applies in relation to a person if the articles of association of the company require him to offer the shares for sale or transfer them if he ceases to be an officer or employee of the company or of one or more group companies or of any group company. Previous Tax Bulletin Article 46 In April 2000 we published an article in Tax Bulletin 46 , Employee Share Plans: Conditional Shares, which sought to explain the interpretation of Sections 140A - H ICTA 1988.

d718	A wind of revolution blows, the storm is on the horizon. ' Around the same time as these words were spoken, Marx and Engels published the first edition of the Communist Manifesto. The events which were to unfold in the same year not only confirmed what they had written, but would leap ahead of it, further developing their understanding of the revolutionary process.

Nipping complaints in the bud together with appropriate apologies will often be sufficient, but this guide describes when we should go further and offer some tangible redress.

This revised guide describes that scheme and supersedes the guidance issued in March 2001. It gives further amplification to some of the issues that have [...]

She went to work at the Daily Telegraph and worked like a trojan until 2am at night and every weekend for about six months on her Good Deal Directory plan. It was launched, in the form of a newsletter, at the Chelsea Flower Show in May 1992. We bravely had 80,000 newsletters printed and hired students to give them out. But it was incredibly hard going and, at the end of the five-day show, we had only got rid of 2,000! said Noelle. But the newsletters that had been handed out generated interest and Noelle found herself [...]
d723	With the growing acceptance that an examination-focused assessment system isn't appropriate for all, Gareth Mills, Head of Futures and Innovations at the Qualification and Curriculum Authority (QCA), provides insight into how his sketches for a future assessment landscape are taking shape. No-one criticises winter flowers for blooming 'late' nor great inventors for not coming up with their ideas sooner. So why do we expect millions of individuals to be exam-ready at the same time each year? Only a decade or so ago, the answer was relatively straightforward; paper and pencil tests were the only viable way of assessing large numbers of students against an agreed set of criteria. But, as Mills points out, if you [...]

In Syria, government military aircraft targeted rebel-held districts in the northern city of Aleppo, killing at least 15 people according to opposition activists. In parallel, Damascus announced that it had retaken control of the key Damascus - Homs supply highway after gaining ground in the battle for the strategic Qalamoun region. London and Washington decided to suspend all non-lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition fearing that military equipment may fall under the control of Islamic radical groups. In Syria, the conflict has been going on for over 1,000 days, and to date, the [...]

To answer ""yes"" to all of these questions, you need to show that: You have a sufficient range of data. This means that you have results for at least five different values of the thing you are investigating (i.e. five temperatures, five voltages etc.) You have taken repeat readings for each of these values.

d729	But hope is in practice far more a matter of temperament than of rational assessment. It can be irrational, based on no evidence and still be hope. But when a favourable result is conclusively impossible, temperament will still dictate that some will work hard to alleviate suffering and to try to avert disaster - but then it is no longer hope but self-delusion. Thus, one may hope and expect a good future outcome in some set of circumstances. The outcome may be uncertain but the past record may show more favourable outcomes than the opposite - perhaps even without us understanding what [...]

d731	We also hear that established artists equally find themselves being pressed to authorise reproductions and waive their copyright licence fees. All of this is odd and runs contrary to the spirit and letter of the new copyright rules. These were introduced for the specific purpose of removing these practices and strengthening all artists' bargaining positions when negotiating non-selling public sector showings. In cases where young artists' works are being presented by small galleries they may reasonably decide to waive their fees for reproducing their work in a catalogue or on posters. Such a gallery is likely to be [...]

So it is convenient, though not good engineering, to quote the size of a drop hammer as simply the weight of the tup. It is not surprising that we did not get very far in looking at the weights of different parts of a helve hammer to answer our question. We are now able to rephrase our question more precisely as: 'What size of drop hammer will deliver the same energy at each blow as the Wortley No 2 hammer?,. In order to [...]

'I just knew that it was not going to be a long-term thing for me,' says Strachan, noting that he had seen several colleagues drift into unemployment and struggle to find a career after life in the armed forces. His first business venture took him into paintball, the leisure pursuit personified by images of aggressive Rambo wannabes. In 1989, the game was only beginning to take off in Scotland, but within the year 16 companies [...]
d734	Most would agree that medical science lacks the explanatory power of the physical sciences, but its grounding in robust bodies of life and health science research suggests something more systematic than praxis. As an alternative, medical science and medical practice can be regarded as distinct, as the goal of practice is to improve health while scientific study aims to achieve theoretical understanding. The insurgence of evidence-based methods to medical research over the past two decades, however, has challenged the framing of the goals of medical science. With its focus on outcomes research, clinical research has been largely redirected towards practical end of improving human health. Philosophy of medicine is typically distinguished from biomedical ethics, although the [...]

We would never knowingly let someone board a plane who we suspected of having swallowed cocaine, but I am certain that we could catch many more people if we had more resources to devote. ' Corrupt officers have been known to transport drugs in their own vehicles, to block off roads to allow planes to take off and land and to turn a blind eye to shipments being smuggled out of the country in return for bribes. In January 1999, 127 officers in the Portland Division were transferred after allegations that some had formed an alliance with members of a Colombian cocaine cartel. Eight months later the entire Special Anti-Crime Taskforce was disbanded after some of its officers were found to be [...]

Until the end of the thirteenth century the abbot of Stanley was more or less a regular attendant at the Cistercian General Chapter . The abbot was also summoned to the early English parliaments; in 1311-17 he was called five times to Westminster, York or Lincoln and in 1322 he was summoned to the provincial council in Lincoln. The abbey suffered some serious economic set backs during the course of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In 1212 a [...]

d753	Because it is a history of the Labour Party, Fielding's book only touches on these bitter years. Yet there is enough here to give a taste of the mood. It also demonstrates why a generation of activists, faced with the disaster of Labour in office and the erosion of shop floor confidence turned their energies towards shifting the Labour Party leftwards. Fielding's collection charts both their failure to do that and the whole process through which the right wing took control of the party, culminating in Tony Blair's launch of New Labour. Blair's landslide victory of 1997 had a similarity with that of 1945 in that people were [...]

Perhaps more important than the question of whether to seek a match or mismatch, is whether it is appropriate to consciously redesign an instructional strategy as learning style may not be temporally stable. Research indicates learning style is not a stable construct, so one may alter instructional style to meet a learning style that will itself change, requiring a further change in instructional strategy. This also assumes that instructional style is the only variable affecting learning style. There are a number of [...]
d772	The party at the Imperial Hotel on Friday night apparently went well and the conference itself was lively and animated with heated debates on Heinlein, Larry Niven, and Tau Zero. A vocal trio of George Hay, Rog Peyton, Bob Parkinson, and Dr. Cohen kept audience response at a high level and other fans and authors present included Mark Adlard, Peter Tate, Vic Hallet, Rog Peyton (with bookstore), Malcolm Edwards, the Pardoes, & others. The NBL-SF Foundation book show was adequate without being exciting and was cumbered with some hideous crayoned scrawls and scribblings which George Hay said had 'accreted' somewhere in the exhibit's tour. A very unfortunate and subjective response from me likened the conference to a nightmare dream of a miserable convention (few fans, few rooms, extremely short, ancient porters, book-lined interiors, and so on).

d773	This was not however an allegiance to the British state, to its parliament, or even to its monarch, but to those constitutional arrangements which were vital to the maintenance of the Ulster Protestant way of life. The basis of the Union, therefore, was a contract between two separate parties, and not an internal agreement between members of the one family. In essence, this definition of the Union was supported by David Trimble, who emphasised not that unionists were simply a section of the United Kingdom separated by geography, but rather that they were a specific cultural community where loyalty to Britain was granted on a de facto basis, rather than Northern Ireland belonging in a de jure manner to the UK. Yes, there is a sort of contract relationship. I'm sure you [...]

d782	In China, SHP stations are defined as those with installed capacity up to 25 MW, though even 50 MW stations can also be recognized as SHP, since there is a special policy VAT rate of 6%. However, the prevailing global standard for classification as SHP is 10 MW. Though it is only a difference in definition, it reflects the trend towards bigger SHP stations in China. Accordingly, problems have arisen which are similar to those encountered in the large hydro power sector, including complex construction, long construction periods, serious impacts on the environment, difficulty in financing, and development beyond the local capacity to support SHP.

d790	Two factors influence the price of housing. The first is the demand for housing within a particular area in relation to the number of houses available, and the second is the amount of money that is available for people to borrow in order to purchase a house. If there is a very great demand for people to live in a particular area, house prices will go up. If the amount of money that is created by the banks to be lent to potential purchasers is effectively unlimited, then prices will shoot up even higher.

A diet free of meat, fish, milk and eggs is by far the safest and one that I highly recommend. Why eating animals increases your chance of infection It makes sense that bugs in animals are much more likely to infect us than bugs found in plants.

In fact, people [...]

The dependence of the industry on the scale of exported coal made the industry particularly vulnerable for coal fields that were dominated by the export trade.

The industry was concentrated in certain areas: South Wales and Northumberland and Durham each produced 20 percent of the country's production and Yorkshire and Scotland another 15 percent. Earlier growth in these areas [...]

Equally baffling are the requirements that all Israelite slaves must be released from servitude when a Jubilee year comes round and that every Israelite must return to his ancestral land. Commentators are quick to point to the problems. Unlike the equivalent Exodus and Deuteronomic rules, which have slaves released after six years, the Levitical law could have a slave serve for forty-nine years. In effect, those who became slaves just after a Jubilee year [...]
d806	Lasting organisation of workers across industry was created in a few short years and, as journalist Mary Heaton Verse wrote in 1938: 'Labour has shown in its struggles an inventiveness, intelligence, and power greater than anything before in its long history. Whole communities of workers have been transformed'.52 The contradictions of the long boom In 1938 US unemployment stood at 19 percent, and 40 percent of industrial capacity was unproductive. The New Deal had not been able to prevent a renewed slump. But massive state and private investment in production for the Second World War soon changed all that. From 1940 onwards US industrial production expanded enormously, and [...]

However, Jill has got some baking to get on with and smoking in her kitchen is strictly taboo. Lilian is not impressed with Christine and George's plans for the police house: it will still be a dump when they have finished it. She is in full flow about the holiday in London which Scott is planning for them both in three weeks time, when Jill suddenly remembers Joe's Jottings on the radio. Lilian is not impressed with that either and does not [...]
d808	Cetnar got loose on the Raider's end of the court, finding his shooting form and launched five three pointers in the space of just a few minutes, causing Plymouth to not only catch up from 29 - 37 lead the Crusaders had, but to continue on a scoring spree while Crusaders remained silent, to lead 43 - 38. The Bupa Crusaders had a 7 1/2 minute spell where all they scored were three free throws, while the Raiders relentlessly continued their plunder. Player / coach Dip Donaldson, who was making a rare appearance in Crusader kit, contributed four points during his on court appearance, but was then involved in a pushing incident which saw him being ejected from the game. This unprecedented occurrence by Donaldson seemed to [...]

EU and member state policies are drafted and implemented in the shadow of this factor. It conditions absolutely the ground rules for any European Taiwan policy and any potential for expanded relations between Taiwan and the European Union. The union and its member states officially consider Taiwan an economic entity, with which they are allowed to develop economic but not political relations. In practice, however, political and economic issues are so closely intertwined that the [...]"

Born in Liverpool in 1921, Saunders was a boyhood Red. Although he never represented the club as a player or a manager, he filled most other roles. He served the club as director and scout, aswell as his excellent work in the bootroom.

They said Saudi Arabia could also boycott an annual summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), to be hosted by Qatar this year. The GCC regional political and economic alliance also includes Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman and the United Arab Emirates. It was not immediately clear if the Saudi move was linked to Qatar's decision to allow their mutual ally, the United States, access to Qatari military facilities that could be used in a possible attack against Iraq. Faced with a possible refusal from Saudi Arabia to be a launch pad for strikes on Baghdad, Washington [...]

When connecting a single speaker to the subs high level input the 3 bare end wires are connected as follows: RED and YELLOW are wound together and connected to the + (positive) terminal of either the speaker itself or the speaker out of the AV amp. The BLACK wire is then connected to the - (negative) terminal of either the speaker itself or the speaker out of the AV amp, depending on where you placed the red and yellow cables.

There are two components to a person: his present state of mind and his past states of mind.

In my 'creative illness' I formulated a view of my ego that was based on my empirical results. This [...]

d824	On the eve of World War I, tensions were rising not only within European states, but among them, as well. Overseas expansion had helped to maintain the balance of power system in Europe by providing a compensatory mechanism. And in spite of the heavily militarized and competitive character o Europe's overseas expansion, diplomatic instruments were found to regulate it such that conflicts over territory were prevented from escalating to war. However, as more and more countries began to pursue dualistic, externally- oriented economic expansion, conflict over still unexploited territories in Africa and Asia increasingly threatened to lead to war. At the same time that overseas [...]

These horrific acts of collective punishment are war crimes by any standard and a terrible echo of the methods used by the Nazis against the Jews of Europe in World War II. They too saw their opponents as untermenschen - sub-humans. In using similar methods against the Palestinians, the Sharon government engages in a grotesque misrepresentation and misuse of the historic suffering of the Jews for its own political ends. As for the United States government, the Bush regime [...]

In the 16th Century the High Street was regarded as a 'grande place' of Europe.

It's something of a triumph for MPVs (which, in the Alliance & Leicester study, includes 4x4s) that they are far more expensive than city cars but depreciate at a similar rate. By means of a completely different category system, Alliance & Leicester broadly agrees with the trends found by Glass's, though it is more pessimistic about the values of the Superminis. By far its lowest rating is for Family Cars, by which it means the repmobiles described by Glass's as Upper Medium. Ex-fleet cars [...]
d833	The problem is that Kylie, no matter how short the mini-skirt, will never be anything other than wholesome. She sings about sex with all the passion of a particularly prudish kindergarden teacher, and the songs, written predominantly by Stock, Waterman and Minogue herself, are just dull in spite of 'provocative' titles like 'Right Here, Right Now' and 'I Guess I Like It Like That'. The whole PWL format has long since lost any spark of life and songs like 'Too Much Of A Good Thing' and 'Finer Feelings' are simply uninspiring, totally predictable and tedious. The ballads are run-of-the-mill efforts, completely devoid of emotional depth.None of this criticism is aimed directly at Kylie, who does, in all fairness, endeavour to [...]

d840	Indeed, a supremely important feature in Balzac's characters is that most are spendthrifts of this vital force, a fact that explains his monomaniacs who are both victim and embodiment of some ruling passion; avarice, as in the main character of Gobseck, a usurer gloating over his sense of power, or the miserly father obsessed with riches in Eugénie Grandet; excessive paternal affection, as in the idolatrous Learlike father in Le Père Goriot; feminine vindictiveness, as evidenced in La Cousine Bette and a half-dozen other novels; the mania of the art collector, as in Le Cousin Pons; the artist's desire for perfection, as in Le Chef-d'oeuvre inconnu; the curiosity of the scientist, as in the fanatical chemist of Le Recherche de l'absolu; or the vaulting and frustrated ambition of the astonishingly resourceful criminal mastermind Vautrin in Illusions perdues and Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes. Once such an obsession has gained a hold, Balzac shows it growing irresistibly in power and blinding the person concerned to all other considerations. The typical structure of his novels from the early 1830s onward is determined by this approach: there is a long period of preparation and exposition, and then [...]

d842	To Baudrillard, hyper-reality is such that it can comfortably and endlessly encompass both the vegan squat cafe and Marco Pierre White, and it is not a matter of an opposition between authenticity and illusion, or a dialectic of recuperation and detournement. If this is true, however, why do the institutions of power waste time and resources destroying traveller and squat communities? Why have television stations refused to sell Kalle Lasn advertising space? In the end, to challenge the passivity that wrings its hands at, yet accepts, environmental pollution, exploitation, the alliance of government and big business in Third World oppression, structural unemployment and a carceral approach to social problems, we must create intellectual and psychological freedom. To do this, we must be able to [...]

It has always been believed that drinking alcohol raises the risk of developing gout, but no large-scale study had ever been conducted to prove or disprove the theory.

d848	In all of his years tracking Nessie sightings, he said that he's never seen nor heard of an image of the creature lit by the moon. For those keeping score at home, this marks the third 'official' Nessie sighting accepted by Campbell's group for 2018. Ironically, of the two other sightings so far this year, one of them also happened to be from a young girl at Loch Ness who noticed something out of the ordinary on the water. Why Nessie appeared to the pair of youngsters is something of a mystery, although skeptics may say that it has something to do with the imaginative minds of children. Fans of the 'monster,' on the other hand, might argue that young people are ideal candidates for an encounter, since they have not been subjected to the decades of debunking which [...]

d858	With a title even less appealing than its premise is original, American Ultra looks to mash together the stoner comedy with the sleeper cell thriller... as if The Bourne Identity were rewritten to star James Franco and Seth Rogen. Problem is, it's not a very good representative of either genre with a couple of leads who fail at being funny while the hyper-violent action is never all that thrilling. The movie genre mashup is a tough thing to pull off successfully, as is the blending of extreme violence with dark comedy. Attempting both techniques in the same film proves to be too much for both director Nima Nourizadeh (Project X) and screenwriter Max Landis (Chronicle), as their American Ultra is a mixed-up [...]

d861	Taylor (1997) points out that it is necessary for a journalist to be present where the action is, else it can only be second hand information that minimizes the impact of the story. As discussed before he also gives emphasis to the fact that modern communication and advanced technological facilities have increased access to scenes of horror from the battlefield, which was not possible a century ago. The ability of the media to bring such scenes of war to people's homes has widened the arena of warfare beyond those who are directly affected by the fighting. The media can turn all wars that they can get access to a matter a of wider public concern all over the world, even if people are not directly involved or affected by it. Such is the impact of global media that it can play a role in [...]
d862	The Court and, in the past, also the European Commission for Human Rights, handed down a series of ground-breaking judgments, recognising that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was a violation of fundamental rights, and gradually expanding this general principle to areas such as employment and child custody. The decisions of the Court are of the greatest importance because they oblige changes in national legislation which is found to be incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.

d863	Finally we all knew at the end of May, that we could actually spend our vacation together. The adventure starts Everything started on Sunday, June 25th -- naturally with a super-vacation grinning of two want-to-be-globetrotters. We were loading our bikes onto the train to Frankfurt, 10 and 13 kg of baggage, Gerhard of course also with his sound equipment and tools for the bikes. The little bike minicomputers started on the distance from the train station to Frankfurt airport to count our first 10 vacation kilometers. Of course this [...]

Personally, I am supportive of faith schools but I recognise that there is an alternative view that our education should be entirely secular. A lot of questions need to be openly and honestly addressed. I concur that the ideal is good local community schools, which means investing adequately in all our schools. It is not sufficient to attack schools that have more facilities than another; we need to [...]
d865	Notes Joseph had been mercilessly thrown into a dried-up water pit by his own brothers, because they were jealous of him and his popularity with their father. We know that he pleaded with them for his life (Genesis 42 v 21) and that his distress and horror were so memorable that the brothers were still referring to it years later. It must have been heart-rending stuff - after all, Joseph faced a slow and painful death by starvation or drowning, and he was doubtless sobbing and crying out for mercy and rescue persistently. And yet we read that the brothers sat down to eat, apparently completely untouched and unmoved by his cries and pleas! Nothing in their consciences [...]
d866	In one arcade I visited recently in the city, a single go of Afterburner cost ¬£1. Even so, there were loads of people queueing up for a go with money in their hands. I kid you not, and it usually takes three to four goes just to find out what's going on. How many machines have you seen with the instructions on them? I can imagine that hundeds of young boys are gladly [...]

New survey finds one in three people now aware of Crossrail - 23 Apr 04 A new survey has found that just over one in three people (36 per cent) living within walking distance of Crossrail stations claim to be aware of the scheme. This figure is comparable to the proportion who say they are aware of other large London transport projects. Crossrail commissions urban landscape artist to depict today's railway - 7 Apr 04 Crossrail has commissioned professional artist, Ian Cryer, to paint a series of twenty first century urban landscapes which are linked by a common thread - the rail infrastructure that runs through them. In this way, the [...]
d869	I have described the impact of globalisation. But what are the transforming forces driving it? One is the creation and use of new knowledge. This has always been part of the story of economic progress, from the days of the spinning jenny to the invention of electricity. But today it explains anything from 50-80% of economic growth, and how well any nation creates, manages and uses knowledge has become the most decisive [...]
d870	We learn that the lovehearts lead to erratic behaviour in late night cafes, 'go wrong when they come on too strong' and, although lots of fun, we are warned not to bring William any back if we go to Amsterdam. A cautionary tale we should all take to heart. Aimless Conversation is a boy/ girl duo that quickly wins over the crowd with its heady mix of strummed guitar and breathy vocals. Their opening number is an atmospheric tale of a failing relationship that involves 'words that come back to haunt me', being 'too cold to care', the sentiment of the lyrics echoed by increasingly more vicious strumming of the acoustic guitar. It [...]

My girlfriend was at the back at one of our shows and she said there were a lot of old people dancing to our music. It seems the wheel comes full circle. When you're young you're capable of enjoying things innocently and when you're old you [...]
d872	If anyone had been dozing in the audience at the beginning of the show, they were brought instantly to their senses by the ear-splitting volume of the opening music. But it's a highly appropriate beginning for a startling and emotional rollercoaster of a play, which is not what it first seems, and leaves the audience with almost as many questions at its conclusion as it poses throughout its duration. Most of the highly charged action takes place in a dingy locker room in an anonymous manufacturing plant of some kind, possibly located on a remote and bleak industrial estate. At the start of the play, Peter brings Una furtively into the litter-strewn room. It's soon apparent that the [...]
d873	But I'm sure I'm willing enough, and give me time to get accustomed; so, Martha, wench, what's the use of crying so, and slapping me if I come near? This last was sotto voce , and had the effect of making Martha bounce out of the room, to be followed and soothed by her lover. Whereupon Miss Matty sat down and cried very heartily, and accounted for it by saying that the thought of Martha being married so soon gave her quite a shock, and that she should never forgive herself if she thought she was hurrying the poor creature. I think my pity was more for Jem, of the two; but both Miss Matty and I appreciated to the full the kindness of the honest couple, although we said little about this, and a good deal about the chances and dangers of matrimony. The next morning, very early, I received a note from Miss Pole, so mysteriously wrapped up, and with so many seals on it to secure secrecy, that I had to tear the paper before I could unfold it. And when I came to the writing I could hardly [...]

But Shia leaders have said they will compromise no further. It has emerged that US President George Bush phoned a Shia leader earlier this week [...]
d875	This country has a history of unleashing bombs on other countries and fighting unjust wars hiding under a banner of false patriotism and false pride in order to justify our cause. Our cause is simply evil and hated all around the world. Our foreign policy causes us to kill and call it casualties of war; and when they kill, we call it crimes against humanity. And then we find that later we were behind their killing and supported it as we did in the case of the 7-year war between Iraq and Iran. Our foreign policy also makes it okay to [...]

Why do most pregnant teenagers opt for abortion in some areas, while most have babies in others? And what [...]
d877	For example if they earn ¬£20,000 and have paid ¬£2,500 in income tax, their average rate of tax is 12.5%. However, their marginal rate of tax will be 23% as that is the rate they will pay on the next pound they earn. A balanced budget arises when the government receives the same amount of money from taxation as it is spending. Classical economists argued that this should always be the aim of government policy. Keynesians on the other hand said that in times of low economic activity the government should run a deficit (spending more than its revenue) to [...]

It is a paper you cannot make head nor tail of, and at the end come five or six long folded diagrams that open out and show peculiar zigzag tracings, flashes of lightning overdone, or sinuous inexplicable things called `smoothed curves' set up on ordinates and rooting in abscissae - and things like that. You puzzle over the thing for a long time and end with the suspicion that not only do you not understand it but that the author does not understand it either. But really you know many of these scientific people [...]
d880	This agreement, signed by Barak and Palestinian Chairman Yasser Arafat in October but never implemented, contains a number of measures aimed at reducing the violence and enabling the resumption of negotiations. Sharon, however, rejected this idea. Other participants in the meeting noted that the agreement speaks about renewing negotiations on a final-status accord, whereas Sharon believes any talks that take place should focus on a series of long-term interim agreements. Sharon stressed that he considers himself obligated only to signed agreements that the Palestinians have fulfilled, and certainly not to unsigned understandings that were never implemented. But Arafat, he added, [...]

There has been a sustained level of guerrilla strike action and the ruling class's greatest fear is still that the crisis will ignite a 'social explosion'. Workers have so far been resistant to organised reaction. None of the fascist parties nor the deeply reactionary Communist Party, led by Genadii Zyuganov, have a solid base amongst workers-yet. The problem, however, is that while the majority have [...]

The first enormous gate that we entered was scarred by cannon balls and the Maharaja Man Singh built another, the Jayapol gate, in 1806 following his victory over the armies of Jaipur and Bikaneer.

d885	"If there is a violation -- if it's among the oil buyers -- it's up to their governments to take action. This leaves open the possibility that any oil firm paying Iraq's under-the-table oil surcharge could get away with it, according to industry analysts. Paying a surcharge is hard to prove, particularly when Iraq is dealing with sort of smaller, lesser known traders who come from countries that don't see eye-to-eye with the United States on sanctions,"" said Raad Alkadiri said of the Petroleum Finance Co. in Washington. Iraq's U.N.-sponsored oil sales are now picking up again after disruptions since December 1, when customers balked at buying oil after Baghdad asked for a 50-cent-per-barrel surcharge payment outside U.N. control. Iraq has enlisted a number of little-known companies to boost oil sales toward its two million barrels per day export target, [...]"

In his speech he stressed that both military intervention and economic interference and domination, through so-called ""development assistance"", are at the centre of the government's policy towards African countries. Intervention on behalf of the monopolies will continue to be carried out for alleged humanitarian reasons or for ""democratic reform"" and so-called ""peacekeeping"". In this regard it is clear that the government has clear aims to develop its own proxy states in Africa to carry out such intervention. The British government, far from [...]"

d894	As soon as the season allowed, Sulla threw himself with vehemence on the Piraeus; he in fact succeeded by missiles and mines in making a breach in part of the strong walls of Pericles, and immediately the Romans advanced to the assault; but it was repulsed, and on its being renewed crescent-shaped entrenchments were found constructed behind the fallen walls, from which the invaders found themselves assailed on three sides with missiles and compelled to retire. Sulla then raised the siege, and contented himself with a blockade. In the meanwhile the provisions in Athens were wholly exhausted; the garrison attempted to procure a capitulation, but Sulla sent back their fluent envoys with the hint that he stood before them not as a student but as a general, and would accept only unconditional surrender.

d905	Since most commemorations were restricted to predominantly Catholic areas the major confrontations depended on the political environment and the tactics that the police and army deployed during the events. However, it is noticeable that there has been a growing acceptance by the forces of the state of republican political expression and, as the focus of that expression has shifted from the paramilitary to the political, from the IRA to Sinn Fein, demonstrations and commemorations have begun to gain greater access to city and town centres. In some respects the form of opposition to the state has returned to the tactics of the civil rights movement and away from than military confrontation. It is also clear that under direct rule the methods of policing loyal order parades has changed. As many loyalist parades reflected the influence of paramilitary groups in the displays of the blood and thunder bands [...]
d906	Some were crucified in the arena, others thrown to wild animals, and still others were burned alive as living torches to light Nero's garden at his Golden House. St. Peter died during the Neronian persecutions. Because of this most well known persecution, Nero was written into history as one of the most depraved and cruel of the Roman emperors. After all, Christians held worship services underground in the city tombs known as catacombs and they had mass where they ate the body and blood of Jesus Christ. This made the Romans think that the Christians were cannibals and the reason for this is because the Romans never [...]

d908	It was discovered that although it prevented breast cancers from developing, 'it also increased the rate of lethal side effects - blood clots and endometrial cancer', and 'these almost cancelled out its benefits, and tamoxifen is now not generally recommended as a preventive drug in the UK'. Returning to the matter of the trials of letrozole being ended, the head of the breast unit at the Royal Marsden Hospital was quoted as saying 'the decision was 'unfortunate'', and the head of statistics at Cancer Research UK said 'there was a trend in North America to 'get a quick answer', not wait for long-term results'. The article concluded with the observation that it was the drug manufacturers who gained from such decisions and patients were the 'losers'. On 24 October 2003, The Times reported in ' Lancet accuses 'unprincipled' AstraZeneca', that the Lancet , 'the world's oldest medical journal', had accused AstraZeneca 'of marketing a cholesterol-lowering treatment in the absence of reliable proof that it is safe and effective'. The article stated an issue of the Lancet being published in October 2003 claimed 'Astra-Zeneca has used 'unprincipled' sales tactics to [...]

So pro-German or Nazi parties received less votes than in 1939. On 29 August 1943, after growing resistance, the collaborationist line of the government fell out of sympathy with the populace and after a German demand for the introduction of the death sentence for sabotage was rejected, it fell and martial law was introduced. Shortly after, the Germans went for the interned Communists to send them to concentration camps, and a similar [...]

d911	Why do debates persist over the safety of new technologies such as genetic modification and mobile phones? Why do the issues never seem to be settled - as far as anything in science can be settled - before products are on the market? It is at least partly because we lack both explicit criteria for funding the scientific research in the first place - such as whether it is safe, ethical, and makes genuine contribution to society - and an audit system to assess the effectiveness of our research & development spending. Consequently, research into the safety of new technologies is done long after they have reached the market, if it is done at all. By that stage, of course, industry [...]

d916	People are going to be playing this for the mini-games and for the most part they're probably going to feel very let down. Some of the games, like sawing a chain quicker than Luigi can or controlling Mario on a pogo stick, can be enjoyable, but most of the others are just there to be there and aren't necessarily that much fun. The solo experience around the world of Shroom City is pretty well crafted and can provide you with a good amount of playtime, assuming you can actually get into it and enjoy it. It does tend to drag along a lot when one of the people sends you on a fetch Quest, where you have to travel across the entire board to get something and bring it back, something we discovered wasn't exactly a lot of fun many, many years ago. However, the variety in the different quests and in the villagers themselves (all straight from the Mario universe) helps keep things fresh and [...]

We outline these analyses below. In this section we consider the extension of Hutchins et al's analysis of direct manipulation to the design of tangible user interfaces. As argued earlier, in traditional humancomputer interfaces (ie graphical user interfaces or GUIs), a distinction is typically made between input and output. For example, the mouse is an input device and the screen is the output device. In tangible user interfaces this [...]

d920	During the conflict French and American prisoners were detained in what now is Dartmoor Prison. Some of the officers were allowed out on parole to live in the border towns or villages. One of the conditions of parole was that the men were not allowed to venture past stipulated distances from their lodgings. In some places these were specific parole stones and in others local landmarks such as The Watching Place. This may have marked the limit for any parolees living in Moretonhampstead and it was here that local bounty hunters would wait and watch because if any prisoner [...]

Then they had to make way for Ozma to welcome the tin man, and the army caught sight of him and set up a cheer, and every body was delighted and happy. For the Tin Woodman was a great favorite with all who knew him, and his sudden recovery after they had thought he was lost to them forever was indeed a pleasant surprise. Before long the cavalcade arrived at the royal palace, where a great crowd of people had gathered to welcome their Queen and her ten children. There was much shouting and cheering, and the people threw flowers in their path, and every face [...]

Humanitarian efforts in the Sudanese and Chadian refugee camps - their successes and failures, and life for an aid worker on the front lines.

When [...]
d924	All these factors are linked, creating a 'chain' which is difficult to break. Poverty is also strongly linked to being out of work, though those in work are often poorly paid too - half of all children living in poverty have a working parent. If you are disabled or from an ethnic minority community you will face prejudice and hostility that makes it even harder for you to make a decent living. If you are a woman you will often have additional responsibilities as a carer, making it harder for you to get and keep a job. You might have to [...]

d926	"She said that produces a very ""dangerous people"" and that is why these connections are kept invisible. Inez McCormack went on to talk about the union contingent she had come with from Ireland; men and women of Republican and Loyalist backgrounds who have fought together against the evils of Thatcherism and who campaigned for the yes referendum in the north of Ireland. She spoke about the Good Friday Agreement and the efforts of these community activists in both communities who contact each other to alert each other when trouble is breaking out. She said that ten years ago many people regarded this as too dangerous, too determined, too irrelevant, too idealistic just to battle for a different type of vision. She concluded by saying that to those ""dangerous people"" and you ""dangerous people"", it is not about [...]"

d928	Therefore, it's always refreshing to see something a bit different, especially if it's more entertaining than the intricacies of d'Hondt . Unfortunately, 'refreshing' requires thinking, and thinking is, on the whole, either unwittingly shirked or unwarrantedly indulged. So it is that I direct you all to Ben Saunders's blog , Praesidium , which comes to you from the noble home of the poor man's Cambridge University, viz.Oxford. Young Ben is doing a PhD on 'Lottery Voting' , inspired by some unknown faceless academics of a bygone era (the eighties). Quoth Dr (pending) Saunders: The proposal is that elections are held as at present, but instead of votes being counted up and the side with most votes winning, one vote is drawn at random to [...]

d930	His body was. thence presently translated to the isle of Lindisfarne, and buried in the cemetery of the brethren. Some time after, when a larger church was built there and dedicated in honour of the blessed prince of the Apostles, his bones were translated thither, and laid on the right side of the altar, with the respect due to so great a prelate. Finan,who had likewise been sent thither from Hii, the island monastery of the Scots, succeeded him, and continued no small time in the bishopric. It happened some years after, that Penda, king of the Mercians, coming into these parts with a hostile army, destroyed all he could with fire and sword, and the village where the bishop died, along with the church above mentioned, was burnt down; but it fell out in a wonderful manner that the buttress against which he had been leaning when he died, could not be consumed by the [...]

d932	These common elements include not only many substantive issues but also an underlying philosophy that emphasises holistic and collaborative approaches rather than a narrow and alienating professionalism. The mushrooming interest in 'health for all' strategies offers an important opportunity to advance this agenda locally, nationally and internationally. Such developments present dangers and opportunities. At worst, established public health interests will merely adopt a new language while in practice offering no real accommodation to the agendas and organisational forms pioneered outside conventional political structures. Equally, environmentalists keen to emphasise the new and unique quality of their agenda risk overlooking some important continuities with the public health tradition, thereby ignoring the very real strengths of that tradition and the potential for [...]
d933	"The song-poem story involves a succession of publishing and recording companies that have occupied the lowest rungs of the music industry ladder for over 100 years. By appropriating the rhetoric of the legitimate (so-called) music industry, the owners of such companies prey on the dual yearnings among the general public for access to the inner sanctum of show business and a means to get rich quick, as well as the fact that nearly everyone has written some sort of poem at one point in their life or another. Song-poem entrepreneurs (called ""song sharks"") manipulate these facets of human nature to deceive naïve individuals into subsidizing a quest to have their poem become the lyric of a smash hit record. In the parlance of this parallel-universe enterprise, ""song-poem"" is code for the originating verse. The reason that a code is resorted to bespeaks of the patronizing nature of the song-poem game: its proprietors believe that their typical customer is too dumb to [...]"

I could be charitable and say that he [...]"
d935	As a result, Mandel says, the work force is deeply demoralized. Under these conditions, it is not surprising that labour activism has followed a downward curve over the last 13 years. Nonetheless, Mandel argues that in factories where workers have found a way to fight back, they have won significant gains. The same lesson can be drawn from his detailed discussion of conditions in Ukraine and Belarus. His Ukrainian [...]

d937	She had also discovered that the opposite, 'pulling water' running from the head to the feet, can cause dizziness, blackouts, loss of balance and fainting(2). A recent survey by Christopher McNaney of the People's Research Centre, Alston, has revealed that gypsies and travelling people have a surprisingly low level of illness. When asked about incidences of cancer in their relatives, he found that it is less than 1%, against 25-33% mortality in the rest of the population. Heart disease and other serious illnesses so prevalent in our society are also very low. Their general lifestyle can hardly be attributed to their well-being, as they smoke, [...]
d938	Our intention is to remain a regional airport, rather than to grow to the size of airports such as Heathrow or Gatwick. As we grow, we aim to build upon our reputation as one of Europe's leading regional airports. However concerns about the airports growth have been raised by the county council, which said the expansion could cause congestion, pollution and noise. Councillor Tim Knight, said: 'We welcome the fact that the airport is consulting local people on its plans for growth. It's a valuable asset and helps to [...]
d939	Addressing information security on a global level clearly raises questions. Many within the defense, national security and intelligence communities rightly raise concerns about what international actually means. Yet, we must address these questions with solutions and not simply ignore the international arena. To enable the dialogue that is needed in this area, ITAA and WITSA conducted the first Global Information Security Summit in Fall 2000. This event brought together industry, government and academia representatives from around the world to begin the process of [...]
d940	Substantive duties are duties that an employee has to carry out and that represent all or part of the central duties of the employment (this condition is unchanged), those duties cannot be performed without the use of appropriate facilities, no such appropriate facilities are available to the employee on the employer's premises (or the nature of the job requires the employee to live so far from the employer's premises that it is unreasonable to expect him or her to travelto those premises on a daily basis), at no time either before or after the contract is drawn up is the employee able to choose between working at the employer's premises or elsewhere. If one or more of those conditions are not satisfied HMRC officers will contend that the employee is not entitled to relief for the expenses of working at home. That contention is of course without prejudice to the employee's right to appeal to the Commissioners in any case where they believe that, notwithstanding what is said in this article, they satisfy the statutory conditions in Section 336. In practice, we think that any uncertainty is likely to centre on the last two bullet points mentioned above. Later in this article we have therefore provided a number of [...]

d942	Although Cady's crimes are never less than repulsive, he is introduced as an amusing figure compared to the poorly adjusted Bowdens. When they are attempting to behave like a 'normal' family at the screening of Problem Child, we admire his obnoxiousness as he laughs loudly and blows cigar smoke: he's enjoying the film more than they are, and is laughing at its send-up of happy families. His assault on Lori later shocks us out of sympathising with him or laughing at him, and it is this sudden shift in tone which makes Cape Fear so disturbing: we enjoy his disruptive potential until it is fulfilled. Cady and Peyton have both, to some extent, been wronged by the law. Cady went to prison for longer than he would have done had Sam Bowden [...]
d943	We have yet to see which companies will do well and survive, and which will fade away. Products are also distributed unevenly.

d947	The approach provides a generic context and framework that supports at least three crucial process areas requiring management decision, resource allocation, release planning, and process performance monitoring. The report exemplifies the approach with an executable model. The latter reflects the global software process at a high level of abstraction and includes phenomenological observations derived from the laws of software evolution and the behaviours thereby implied. It incorporates concepts such as progressive (e.g., functional enhancement) and anti-regressive (e.g., complexity control) activities and enables the study of policies of human resource allocation to classes of activities.

d948	Seamless meets the 7 critical tests outlined in the key local e-government paper e-gov@local [21], namely: it is joined up and accessible; it is delivered and supported electronically, jointly and seamlessly (this counts as 3 tests); it is open and accountable; and it is used by people. Many organisations have contributed information to the gateway including: 'Age Concern', the BBC, UK Online and NHS Direct Online. The project exemplifies effective public sector partnership between councils at various levels (district, unitary etc.) and Essex Fire and Police Services, local educational establishments, and voluntary organisations. A semi-automatic metadata tool (SeamlessUK.dot) was developed which is template based, and the metadata used throughout is based on Dublin Core, and is e-government compliant. The event ended with a final panel session with delegates breaking out briefly to [...]
d949	Destiny's Child's follow-up effort, 1999's The Writing's On the Wall , was certified 8x RIAA platinum in the United States and went on to sell more than 10 million copies worldwide. The success of that album was matched when Destiny's Child dropped the multi-platinum worldwide smash Survivor in 2001. Ask Kelly if she's pleased with her new album and she beams. I remember how happy I was when we finished The Writing's On The Wall and Survivor because each song was so great. I wanted to [...]
d950	We now know that celebrities are just like us. In fact, they could be us. They all do the same things 'ordinary' people do - they shop, do their washing and look like crap when they go to the corner shop on a weekend morning. This raises some real concerns to me about the economic value of celebrities. Although Walkers Crisps and AMV may beg to differ, is the huge investment in a celebrity really worthwhile when they aren't that different to you and me? I've probably [...]

Incidentally the AMIP guidelines confirm that this is so when in paragraph 8.8 they indicate that ""The report should be regarded as pertinent to the inquiry and may be the subject of debate in a court. It should therefore be filed with the case papers"". It is apparent therefore that Mr Barker embarked on this Review with two inhibiting fetters imposed effectively by himself. First, in our opinion, he [...]"

It would be more or less part of their job to get to know the army press officer as well as possible and that in itself would [...]
d953	"One of marijuana's better known side effects---as an appetite booster---has increased the pressure to legalise the drug for medical use. Many AIDS patients battling the deadly wasting that can be caused by the disease smoke marijuana to stimulate their appetites. This has made the drug a cause celebre for America's powerful and well-organised AIDS activists. There is a clear consensus that marijuana has a positive effect on appetite,"" says Richard Mattes, professor of nutrition at Purdue University in Indiana. But it is uncertain whether a healthier appetite actually leads to weight gain: after a sudden increase in food intake, the body may simply compensate by [...]"

d957	But Volvo's commitment to safety remains. A few of the XC90's safety features include: Roll Stability Control Special steel in a reinforced roof structure IC (Inflatable Curtain) - for all three rows of seats Lower cross-member for increased car-to-car compatibility Customers expect Volvo to retain its lead in the field of safety - irrespective of vehicle type. With the launch of its first-ever SUV, Volvo Cars enters an entirely new segment, and the goal is perfectly clear: to lead the way in terms of safety. As in all other Volvo models, safety in the Volvo XC90 is a holistic concern. Safety is never achieved by simply integrating a number of individual stand-alone features into a car: what is important is the interaction between them - it is this interplay that [...]
d958	The Strategic Rail Authority, the 10-year plan, the creation of Network Rail, the appointment of a new regulator, the scaling down of West Coast mainline reconstruction, threats to cut non-mainline routes, and now the Railway Review, all give ample evidence of the government's desperate desire to find an answer which does not involve re-nationalisation. So what has happened in the real world of Britain's railways? Since privatisation, rail and track renewal costs have trebled and quadrupled. What has been going on inside the privatised track work companies has been corrupt, with myriad companies paying each other vast unjustifiable sums of money which come ultimately from the public purse. The cost price contract has just been a mechanism for [...]

This week, the ""sick and twisted monster"" has been gaoled for 24 months. It transpires that not only did he shoot the ponies (who are still traumatised by the incident) for target practice, but he has even shot at a child! It is a funny kind of legal system where one can escape prosecution for coming within an inch of killing, or at least severely wounding, a human. At the same time, if you have the temerity to attack a couple of nags, you might as well kiss goodbye to liberty for the foreseeable future. To be honest, if the jury [...]"

d961	Two of Toussaint's chief lieutenants, Dessalines and Christophe, recognized their untenable situation, held separate parleys with the invaders, and agreed to transfer their allegiance. Recognizing his weak position, Toussaint surrendered to Leclerc on May 5, 1802. The French assured Toussaint that he would be allowed to retire quietly, but a month later, they seized him and transported him to France, where he died of neglect in the frigid dungeon of Fort de Joux in the Jura Mountains on April 7, 1803. The betrayal of Toussaint and Bonaparte's restoration of slavery in Martinique undermined the collaboration of leaders such as Dessalines, Christophe, and Pétion. Convinced that the same [...]

d964	By following the example of the psalmist's prayer, you can learn to rightly respond to God's Word: The supreme prayer the psalmist breathed is a confession of his inadequacy and God's sufficiency. The psalmist passionately desired to obey God's Word. The psalmist asked for help to turn from vain activities and to desire things of greatest value, including God's Word. We trust you'll derive life-long benefit from this golden alphabet of praise for the Word of God. But should sin seek to [...]

He also encourages teachers to redefine authentic samples or examples of English.

d967	We believe that the main concern of us all is to (1) prevent the daily rise in prices of all our food and clothes and other essentials (it is unbelievable but that the price you can get for a pound of cocoa can't buy a half-pound of fish) and (2) develop a concrete program for raising the standard of housing, living, education, health, food and recreation for all the people. The present situation we face is that we are forced to live in jammed-up, rundown, unpainted houses without toilet and bath, without running water, very poor roads, overcrowded schools where our children can't get a decent education, and without any proper bus service. There is almost no ambulance service in case of illness. We can't afford the cost of food to feed our children properly and this makes it easier for them to catch all kinds of illnesses. There are very few places near home for recreation. All we have is the rum shop to [...]

In the years 1995-1998 there were 15,860 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease, in persons whose ages ranged from 0 to 104 years. The overall incidence was 23 per 100,000, with highest incidence in children under two years and adults over 65 years. About one in 10 cases resulted in death for all ages, and rose steadily from low rates in children to high rates in the over-80s. Higher case-fatality rates were also seen in persons with congestive heart failure, cancer, or who [...]

This is a movie that only the hardiest fans of Laurence Fishburne will want to see.

Philosophies are the engines of political parties. Without them the difference between parties becomes blurred.

My girlfriend at the time had been set the book as part of her linguistics course and I singularly failed to express to her just how wrong-headed Sampson's arguments were - how he completely failed to engage with the whole point of Pinker's book ., for one thing. Of course I was fresh from reading things like Rethinking Innateness and had all the zeal of the new convert. I can't remember the details of Sampson's argument, and now I think i'd like to re-read it to check if i still feel the same way, and maybe to [...]
d982	By implication, what passed for socialist theory - after the ravages of Stalinism and the successive dilutions of social democracy - was quite inadequate for an understanding of the modern world, let alone for undertaking action that connected aims and strategy. Without constant reconnection between aims and a rapidly changing world, theory easily became a set of quasi-religious mantras, esoteric marks of group identity rather than guides to action - and the history of Trotskyist sects is sadly replete with too many examples. Tony Cliff began this reconstruction of theory in his application of the concept of state capitalism to Russia, Eastern Europe and China, and his rejection of Trotsky's absurd idea of a 'degenerated workers' state'. Mike Kidron set out to understand why world capitalism, characterised before the Second World War as apparently in permanent stagnation (in Trotsky's 1938 Transitional Programme, the epoch was one of war and mass unemployment) was in the 1950s expanding with unprecedented speed (and far from mass unemployment, [...]
d983	The control and command functions necessary for capitalism continue to gather around core areas like London. It has managed to sustain its base as the locus of economic and political power despite the loss of 250,000 jobs in the early 1990s. The logic of such spatial concentrations of corporate power brings in its wake a plethora of support functions not usually considered to be part of the so called knowledge economy. These include the routine and specialised tasks that produce, distribute, maintain, clean, equip and house corporate control capabilities. Cities grow by [...]
d984	The disease first struck last November. In March, Liu Jianlin, 64 year-old medical professor who was involved in treating patients, went from Guangdong to Hong Kong to attend a wedding. He was taken ill soon after arrival and admitted to hospital. He asked to be put into quarantine, but was ignored; nor did the hospital warn his contacts. As a result, nine guests in the hotel where he stayed [...]
d985	They visited the John Singer Sargent Exhibition at the Tate Gallery and afterwards worked with the poet Anthony Wilson. This poem was in response to Sargent's portrait of the daughters of Mr Boit. Their parents were on an extended Grand Tour so that these girls grew up in strange hotels in countries where they did not know the language. It is hardly surprising that they all in later life had periods of mental illness. Sargent's [...]
d986	The study concludes that on average, loan size did not stagnant but increased steadily, although at a rate lower than the original village bank model projections. Only programs that allowed non-poverty level loans (loans above US$300) approached the original loan growth rate. Other factors positively associated with more rapid loan growth were urban site selection and restricted internal fund policies. Membership turnover-influx of new clients and drop-out of original clients-was also evident across all programs, dampening loan growth rates by approximately 25%. While [...]
d987	And most importantly, we need to have the ability to use the information for our own benefit and the benefit of others. Our Tribal connection. Most of us live in societies where the pace of life and the pressures brought about by the demands of everyday existence tend to inhibit our perceptive abilities. We even use technology to divert our attention from realities that would impact on us negatively if we allowed ourselves to be open to the influences. Strange but true, we rarely use music for enjoyment and pleasure, but rather, we use it to block out unwanted realities, or, to try and [...]
d988	Of course, in one sense I was wrong - it would be hard to visit Auschwitz and learn nothing. It provides a sense of place. The familiar black and white pictures acquire a greater sense of depth. Finding new perspectives from which to appreciate accounts of the camps helps stop discussion becoming banal, challenging you not to take knowledge for granted, and to come closer to history. Probably my ambivalence about spending my holiday in a concentration camp had [...]
d989	Developing discipline, self-knowledge and acceptance will help to reduce the effect of these drives, and to develop the sense of wholeness, or integration that was discussed in the first chapter. Though these problems can be reduced by the yoga of action, it is meditation that will finally overcome them. When we are driven by our likes and dislikes, by our prejudices and fears, we tend to do things that cause problems for us later on. If we want to avoid building trouble for the future, we need to address the cause of the trouble: that we are confused about who we really are. At the root of the confusion is our misunderstanding about what is real, and when we remove this misunderstanding we [...]
d990	These forms of counselling aim to establish a caring, supportive relationship between client and counsellor, and within this to explore your past experiences and current life. The aim is to help you to see how the past is affecting your life now, and to enable you to make changes. Exploring Thought Patterns - Cognitive Therapy: This approach emphasises that the way we think influences how we feel. By helping you to recognise negative thought patterns which you may have developed without realising it, the aim is to help you to develop more positive attitudes. Behaviour Therapy: The aim of this approach is to change unhelpful ways of behaving that you may have developed, for example avoiding crowds through fear, or [...]
d991	Besides, having burnt all of my bridges behind me, I couldn't not succeed. I was simply not coming back. My life until now had been mostly messy, confusing and painful. Also very lonely, for people confused and scared me. It was only during my deep sojourns into nature, my periods of contemplation, and times close to Spirit that my soul soared and [...]
d992	"Transference occurs because an ill person tends to re-experience emotions instead of remembering them, and the psychiatrist encourages the development of a transference so that the patient will be able to look at this mirror version of old relationships. The subtle and much misunderstood process by which the patient recovers hidden childhood emotions is called reconstruction. We are misled if we believe that we are, except in rare instances, able to find the 'events' of the afternoon on the staircase when the seduction happened,"" Dr. Ernst Kris has written. We are dealing with the whole period in which the seduction played a role. Analysis does not so much attempt to [...]"
d993	The movie first encounters difficulties in its preproduction stage, starting with an uncomfortably small European-funded budget. Then Gilliam must wait for the lead actors, Johnny Depp and French actor Jean Rochefort, to show up on location in Spain. When Depp and Rochefort finally arrive, shooting commences, but within the first few days a torrential rainstorm hits the set, washing away much of the equipment and significantly altering the dry desert landscape. And to make matters much worse, Rochefort, who plays the central role of Don Quixote, falls ill and returns to Paris for medical treatment. As the days of the Quixote-less production go by, [...]
d994	"He further reminded editors ""just as it remains... their responsibility to comply... it is equally their responsibility to know what orders [he had] made in relation to this trial"" (Ibid). Even earlier on the 23rd August 2002 the media's frenzied reportage was the subject of a note of guidance to editors. In light of the torrent of publicity that has continued to be published since Carr and Huntley were arrested and charged, the Attorney General feels bound to remind editors that criminal proceedings... are active... and to remind them of their obligations not to create a substantial risk of serious prejudice to the course of justice. And yet, in November of 2002 Beacon FM's Mark Peters and Lisa Freame were able to call Huntley's defence; ""Like the most unbelievably made-up story in the world ever...I can't believe any member of the jury is going to [...]"
d995	Perhaps it would be sufficient for him to see just Sir Robert Cecil? It was now perhaps suggested by Cecil, privately, that Marlowe might like to bring their mutual friend and former colleague, Thomas Walsingham, along next time, and at t hat meeting - joined by Lord Burghley - they must have discussed the possibility of a faked death. The names of the Cecils' man Poley, Walsingham's man Frizer, and his sidekick Skeres were mentioned. Using Skeres would also be a good means of ensuring that his 'master', the Earl of Essex, [...]
d996	Most fundamentally, the unprecedented ability ICT creates to collect, store, retrieve, reversion, manipulate and transmit data may increasingly bridge the gap between assessment for learning and the more formal assessments of examination and inspection regimes. If this gap is to close, as ever, ICT will be necessary but far from sufficient. While it is unimaginable that the future of learning will be divorced from ICT, it will equally take social, cultural and professional shifts to take us there. More tangibly, examples in personalised assessment, learning to learn and the assessment of joined-up provision seem to be at the leading edge of ICT's use in assessment. In the remainder of this paper, we flesh out these developments, and use them to [...]
d997	The hours before the EME test were spent optimising the position of the feed for best sun noise. The position was quite critical - with the feed a few mm away from optimum the sun noise dropped by a dB! After an hour or so no further improvement could be obtained and we ended up with 13dB of sun noise (at an elevation of 19 degrees with a thin overcast). Our dish mount does not allow elevations above 34.5 degrees, and we had to wait until 5 minutes before the test to see what level of moon noise could be achieved. The [...]
d998	These studio practices were interspersed with sessions at Kevin's house where we went over Kevin's Ideas for new songs. Kevin would sit and play the basic chords on an acoustic guitar and sing the song to us. They never took too long to learn as they were very straightforward. At first all the ideas were Kevins. During the studio rehearsals, Kevin [...]
d999	I knew Chris was a good singer, although I knew I was as good as he was, and like I hoped that would be enough of an acceptance for anyone who came to see us, plus people who came to see the band, all they want is to hear songs as they recognise them. Some say they don't miss Chris, others enjoyed Chris because he played guitar and I don't. Nobody's said it's terrible get someone else! That's the way Earth Band are progressing now. Andy I missed out the bit you have been warmly accepted by even the most die-hard Earth Band fan, people believe you've [...]
d1000	"Given that US-Saudi relations cooled substantially in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks - rifts that may widen further - a Saudi competitor would not be unwelcome in Washington. An unnamed US diplomat confided to Scotland's Sunday Herald that ""a rehabilitated Iraq is the only sound long-term strategic alternative to Saudi Arabia. It's not just a case of swapping horses in mid-stream, the impending US regime change in Baghdad is a strategic necessity. Washington would gain enormous leverage over the world oil market. Opening the Iraqi spigot would [...]"
