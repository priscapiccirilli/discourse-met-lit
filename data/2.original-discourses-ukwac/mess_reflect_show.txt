 Even though I was restored as director of my program, the UW refused to take any action to address the damage done to the program by their actions. My requests to complete the investigation to identify who made the charges were also refused. Requests for use of UW Human Resources to address the effects of the charges were also refused. Subsequently, my chair retaliated by demeaning my work and lowering my rating from "outstanding" to "without merit." Despite the threats to "get me," I cannot want to feel the UW wants to destroy my program; I do believe that this mess reflects abusive misuse of the faculty code to achieve some end I can not define. 

 I don't want to get up as i worry if i stay awake i will lose my energy- so then i go back to sleep and have weird dreams or stay awake and think- neither are good. After i messaged you i tried out some 'worry trees' and i realised what i am doing at the moment isn't working so i am going to get out of bed- make myself as long as it is after 7. I think i am stressed as i have had time off and haven't done any of my jobs- just been lazy. So my house is a bit of a mess. The mess reflects my brain sometimes and again i know i 'should' be on top of things- i never thought i would turn out to be lazy! 

 Under fast track, Congress waives the right to tweak any trade deals, giving the president a stronger hand in negotiating a deal. If Congress doesn't renew fast track, which it may not, reaching a Doha deal will be that much harder. Subsidies will go under the microscope again when Congress debates the farm bill - but hill watchers are predicting farmers don't have to fear much losing their subsidy cushions. More information: See cJ's Trade, Food and Doha pages for more background and stats on farm subsidies. This jumbled up mess pretty much reflects the competency of members of congress. 

 If anyone had been dozing in the audience at the beginning of the show, they were brought instantly to their senses by the ear-splitting volume of the opening music. But it's a highly appropriate beginning for a startling and emotional rollercoaster of a play, which is not what it first seems, and leaves the audience with almost as many questions at its conclusion as it poses throughout its duration. Most of the highly charged action takes place in a dingy locker room in an anonymous manufacturing plant of some kind, possibly located on a remote and bleak industrial estate. At the start of the play, Peter brings Una furtively into the litter-strewn room. It's soon apparent that the mess in the room reflects the mess of the relationship between these 2 people. 

 So we are presented with the bizarre and bewildering spectacle of American planes dropping explosives and food on Afghanistan at the same time. Refugees to whom the West turned a blind eye a few weeks ago are now pushed to the top of the global agenda, as a kind of human shield behind which war can legitimately be waged. Meanwhile, cruise missiles and aid packages are deployed as two different kinds of weapon with the same aim. What began as Bush's 'crusade' against a threat that many in the West tried to compare to the Nazis, has ended up in a bombing campaign against one of the most wretched countries on Earth where, US officials concede, there is almost nothing worth bombing. The resulting mess reflects the state of mind of the Bush administration. 

 Price has issues when the daylight is short. He is worn out. It doesn't take a genius to see this pattern. He is injured, either physically or mentally, not sharp, and will get injured more. </s><s> He should be practicing and re-habbing in Montreal while Lindgren and Montoya carry the load. The whole thing is a micro-managed, meddled with, and ineffective mess that reflects a disorganized mind. 

 I believe one of the desiples said "why do you help them they are bad, he answered because they need help the most." Is it wrong of me or make me co dependent for wanting to help people? However, if someone abuses your trust and takes advantage of your kindness, they deserve no such help. They are so selfish that they believe that they can ruin anyone else's lives without any respect for them at all, just so that they can feel good about the destruction they cause. This mess you've found yourself reflects this completely. 

 Wolves seem logical, but I'm skeptical of them staying out of trouble. And yes, I'd like to see the coyote population go down. It would be good all around, if they stay out of trouble. Just try to stifle the reflex to shoot first and ask questions later. (To the general population, not you alone.) People have been taught to shoot wolves on sight for far too long, and the mess we're in reflects that. 

 So how do we fix this? One idea might be that we can look outside of marketing more to what's happening in the culture; uncover what's captivating humans out in the big world. If we can relate some of this to stakeholders in a tight, succinct way; or do more collaborative exercises that mind-map winning attributes and similarities – we might be better able to convince those in charge to slow down, and take the time to craft something special and unexpected. Not just Hungary: Migrant mess in Budapest reflects larger EU confusion. 

 This forms the basis of your lean strategy and rollout plan. Clarity and Cleanliness. So now you know where to start–except for one thing. What about the mess? You started your career on the floor, back when the shop was a lot smaller. Still, you've known those guys for years. The mess just reflects how they work, right?

 We simply believe, and we think history is on our side, that the best check against corporate power is the competitve marketplace and the power of the consumer dollar (framed, of course, by legal prohibitions on force and fraud). Competition plays mean, nasty corporations off against each other in a contest to serve us. Yes, they still have power, but its negative effects are lessened. It is when corporations can use the state to rig the rules in their favor that the negative effects of their power become magnified, precisely because it has the force of the state behind it. The current mess shows this as well as anything ever has, once you realize just what a large role the state played. 

 So many people were laid off or income was cut here that there are multiple cases where B of A could have restructed loan with out principal reduction and used a defferal of part of the balance and collect it when the house was sold. The banks are being completely illogical when they could be getting income at a lower rate by extending the mortgage placing a portion of the loan on the end. They would rather continue to drive home prices down, move people of of their homes and take on management costs and upkeep of empty property rather than give help to prperty owners. What I meant to say in relation to my post above, (note to self-never post anything after 10pm)is that this whole mess shows how the administrations of Bush and then Obama, (Mr. Obama-Bush)were unwilling to enforce the rules that are on the books because of a connection with the big campaign supporters inside of the financial sector. 

 'Coups' don't come much more cowardly. Instead of different wings of a traditional political party vying for influence, we are witnessing a battle for personal power between cliques grouped around ambitious individuals. As we have discussed before on spiked , this bears more resemblance to the backstabbing court politics of a Shakespearean drama, in which rival factions manoeuvre for the Crown as an end in itself. Blair's frantic ministerial reshuffle, designed to surround him with his few remaining reliable lieutenants, revealed this situation in all its goriness, as he sacrificed everything and everybody on the altar of personal loyalty. That the outcome proved such a mess shows how New Labour's 'control freaks' have lost the plot. 

 With a title even less appealing than its premise is original, American Ultra looks to mash together the stoner comedy with the sleeper cell thriller... as if The Bourne Identity were rewritten to star James Franco and Seth Rogen. Problem is, it's not a very good representative of either genre with a couple of leads who fail at being funny while the hyper-violent action is never all that thrilling. The movie genre mashup is a tough thing to pull off successfully, as is the blending of extreme violence with dark comedy. Attempting both techniques in the same film proves to be too much for both director Nima Nourizadeh (Project X) and screenwriter Max Landis (Chronicle), as their American Ultra is a mixed-up mess that shows moments of great promise but ultimately fails to be the kind of picture it hopes for. 

 We don't comment on current events. We stay out of political controversy." But Harris just went on and on. Meanwhile, a video emerged of another 2020 hopeful, former Vice President Joe Biden, calling a cameraman a "pr*ck." Oddly, another so-called frontrunner, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), didn't make a peep (smart move, Uncle Bernie). The whole mess shows just how weak the 2020 field is.

 In a concrete sense, this doesn't really matter. Presidential budget proposals are aspirational documents, not things that become law, and the congressional budget process is governed by the Congressional Budget Office's scores anyway, not by whatever OMB cooks up. But budgets are important as statements of values. One clear headline value of the Trump budget is an overwhelming preference for cutting taxes on high-income families over providing food, medical care, housing assistance, and other support to low-income families. The growth accounting mess shows a parallel value – or, rather, lack of value – placed on the idea of governing with integrity. 

 When he got caught pandering to both sides of this issue, all he had to do is admit a mistake. But you know how much Obama seems to hate admitting mistakes by now, don't you? Pass that buck Senator! I can't feel sorry for the mess he made since he had two easy shots to avoid it. The fact that he is having this mess right now shows a lacking of maturity. 

 This week's Thursday Thoughts is on the subject of the new teams in 2010. My view has always been that anyone who can turn up with a car that can get through scutineering and a driver who qualifies for a superlicence should be allowed to attempt to qualify. That way the better teams thrive and the less capable disappear. That is not an option due to FIA rules. The USF1 mess shows that the FIA is not capable of assessing teams so I was not particularly convinced that the new teams would start the season let alone finish it. 

 These are the kinds of questions that prove you really don't want to do the assignment or illustrate you only want to hear yourself talk. "When you receive a new assignment, gather your questions, and pose them in an organized way," Oliver suggested. "Never just spout out question after question off the cuff." Being a slob. When you clog the office kitchen sink and leave your garbage around, who exactly are you expecting to clean up after you? "Leaving your mess behind shows lack of responsibility or consideration, arrogance, and immaturity," Randall said.
