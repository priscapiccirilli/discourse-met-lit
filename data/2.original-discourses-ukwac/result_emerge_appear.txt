 Our ancestors were among the first Indians to come in contact with the Europeans (Dutch, English, & Swedish) in the early 1600s. The Delaware were called the "Grandfather" tribe because we were respected by other tribes as peacemakers since we of ten served to settle disputes among rival tribes. We were also known for our fierceness and tenacity as warriors when we had to fight, however, we preferred to choose a path of peace with the Europeans and other tribes ... ' The Grand Hotel , Mackinac Island, Michigan. The world's largest summer hotel since 1887. The Fall of Parity. 'Between Christmas of 1956 and New Year's Day, the first exciting results emerged from a difficult but fundamental scientific experiment at the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) in Washington, DC [currently the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)]. 

 The growth in demand for equal educational rights inevitably strengthens the desire for the development of each teacher's skills for meeting the individual needs of all learners. With a new concentration upon the needs of students with SEN and their transitions, there seems to be some uncertainty with regards to what the development of these skills might mean for teacher education (Mittler 2000). Therefore, in this paper we intend to focus on transitions from the point of view of learners having special educational needs but also by considering the challenges transitions bring for development of teachers' skills. However, our aim is not so much in considering this as a universal issue but instead do it through raising experiences of promoting this in one practical initiative taken within the Baltic countries. For a starting point we will provide some description of this initiative to enable the reader to understand the context in which the forthcoming results emerged. 

 This talk will briefly discuss the South African epidemic of HIV and the need to evaluate structural interventions for HIV prevention as part of the public health response. The talk will then go on to describe the methodology and framework for a community randomised trial of a structural intervention for HIV prevention that is ongoing in South Africa. The IMAGE intervention comprises involvement with a poverty-targeted micro-lending scheme to support business development for women and a programme of participatory training and community mobilisation around issues including gender, intra-household communication and HIV. A short film describing the intervention will be shown. The talk will then briefly describe some of the descriptive results emerging from the baseline and ongoing assessments. 

 This seminar will present the aims and methods of this major research network funded by the ESRC. The network is based around three research projects at the University of Leeds, the University of York, King's College London and the University of Southampton. Work has commenced this year and will continue to 2003. The major aim of the research network is to improve the interface between science education researchers and practitioners, particularly teachers, by developing and evaluating several examples of evidence-based practice, and by improving our understanding of the ways in which practitioners draw upon evidence in taking actions and making decisions. The first stage of project 3, a Delphi study exploring what should be taught about the nature of science, conducted at King's and Southampton has been completed and the results emerging from this work will be presented and discussed. 

 The samples are small, and given that they are drawn from eight cities per sweep, they are unlikely to be representative of the country as a whole. Participation is voluntary and urine test data are not adjusted to take account of the differences in the half-life of drugs (for example, amphetamines remain testable in urine for two days; opiates, cocaine and benzodiazepines for three days; and cannabis up to a month with chronic users). The results thus need cautious interpretation (see Stimson et al., 1998). Nevertheless they give a good idea of the 'order of magnitude' of the relationships between illicit drug use, dependence and offending in this population. Consistent results have emerged from surveys of prison inmates indicating that a significant minority of the adult convicted population are dependent drug users prior to imprisonment (Maden et al., 1991; Singleton et al., 1999). 

 Enough to enable a competent scientist to repeat what you have done or to pick up where you left off and continue the work. Bear in mind also that you must include enough detail to impress the assessors with your grasp of the topic. But beware of including too much information. You do need to demonstrate your ability to separate what's important from what is not (and you should avoid boring the reader!). As your results emerge, identify your one key conclusion. 

 Gentleman that there are significant military and political questions arising in relation to Iraq. That is precisely why my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence took the first opportunity available to come to the House and make a statement on that question. We are looking forward to the referendum taking place in Iraq. Its political implications will be considerable, whichever result emerges. 

 The application, and the testing based on it, changes over time in response to what readers want. Interpretive Review The baseline studies inform the research at a practical level, but also at a conceptual level. They flag issues that may be important, should be tracked as the project progresses, and which are likely to benefit from discussion across the range of stakeholder groups. Interpretive review is an important aspect of the research method. As results emerge, they will be fed back to the target audience for validation, eg results of the reader research will be fed back to readers. 

 We have also extended some of the ideas to internal flows, as described in publication 24. Recently through 2 EPSRC grants we are looking at the stability of flow in compliant channels, pipes and boundary layers, to investigate the effects of heat transfer on the flow stability. Absolute instabilities in boundary layer flows. Recently we have spent considerable effort in devising techniques for studying absolute instabilities in two- and three-dimensional boundary layer flows, see for example publications 30-34,36. A number of significant results have emerged from these studies in particular for the wedge shaped and cusp shaped trailing edge configurations, where we have for the first time been able to look at the effects of separation and compressibility on the flow stability. 

 An overwhelming 94 per cent feel their children's horizons are broadened by travel believing that during the school holidays, children can learn more from travelling to foreign countries with their parents Around 60 per cent think their offspring learn more by travelling and visiting new places than they do in the classroom. Gary Thomas, Head of esure.com Travel Insurance, said: "While we do not condone taking children out of school to go on holiday we are aware that some parents can't afford to take their children away during the most expensive times of the year. Travellers should look to save money in other ways for example opting for holidays with free child places or shopping around for their best deal on their travel insurance. The survey results emerge at the same time the government has struck a deal with travel companies in a bid to halt parents taking their kids out of lessons.

 Although the NIOS could have been replaced by a purely hardware design, there was a considerable saving in complexity and development time by being able to use the pre-constructed building blocks of a processor, a UART and some interfacing PIOs. Fig.1 shows the general arrangement: Fig.1: DES cracker design A pipelined version of the DES algorithm was used with the same input data value being encrypted by a succession of key values. At each clock interval, the intermediate left/right results of each DES stage are clocked into the next set of registers to act as inputs for the next stage of the encryption. Therefore, after an initial start-up period of 16 clocks, results appear from the end of pipeline at the clock rate of 33.33 MHz. 

 Cricket officials are also hoping that once the game takes firm roots in China, they can push cricket's case for inclusion in the Olympic Games. Half of the Â£200,000 comes from the ACC development fund and the rest by the ICC's use of a special fund. ICC CEO Malcolm Speed, now on a tour of the country along with Huq, stressed that people should not expect instant results in China. There's been a very good start in China. This is a 10-year project and no one should be under any illusion that results will appear overnight," he said. 

 Methadone is an opioid which is used widely in the treatment of heroin addiction. It is marketed under the name Physeptone. Effects: These drugs act on the frontal lobes of the brain. They are known to depress pain responses. Following administration results will appear in about 15 to 20 minutes with peak effect in 45-90 minutes. 

 An effective search engine marketing strategy leverages the advantages of all of the major search engines and their advertising channels including natural and paid. Why? Here are three essential reasons why you should expand your search engine marketing strategy beyond just Google, paid search or any other singular search engine marketing strategy to encompass the broader opportunities available for y our business. (1) Paid versus Natural Search: Relevancy and Conversion A common strategy of search engine marketing companies and Internet marketers is to bid for the top paid search listing in Yahoo Search Marketing (formerly Overture) or Google Adwords as a way to acquire the perceived "bread and butter" position in the search results page. The concept is that a search result appearing at the top of the list is the most relevant to the search users' keyword query and therefore will receive the most click-throughs and conversions. 

 Make your picks on top men's and women's events ... A little background on the development of Fantasy Squash from Aidan Harrison Back in December I ran a fantasy squash game at my club in Chicago for an in house competition and the members loved it. So I tested the waters at the SSA GLOBAL Windy City Open in Jan and we had about 40 members and sponsors try to pick the winner of the event. Since then I have been trying to find an online program so I don't have to do everything by hand. At the post tournament dinner at the Windy City, John White embraced the idea of FantasySquash and thought it would be a great way for people to really see if they can predict who will win an event. With the different results appearing at almost every competition, it could make people's picks be in all directions. 

 OWL is a mark-up language for publishing and sharing ontologies- basic semantic definitions of things you can find on the web and how they relate. It will play an important role in the semantic web, and might be used to ensure semantic interoperability elsewhere as well. The presentation is timely, as the W3C is in the final stages of releasing OWL 1.0 in News, April 06, 2003 RELOAD releases beta of open source Metadata editor One issue that keeps popping up in debates about learning objects is the metadata question; how are educators supposed to make an interoperable description of a learning object that will allow it to be found by others? The Reload elarning tool development project decided to attack that problem before any others, with the first results already appearing. 

 The grantors are therefore justified in their rational concerns. Both of the affected farms and the cottages at Rounton Gates are all within slightly over 100 metres of the line as proposed in each of the three alternatives. The farms are to the east in the direction of the prevailing wind, and well within the 400 metres distance where ionised particle effects have been found. The direct exposure to EMFs would be significant at all of the properties. A New results continue to appear which reinforce the public health concerns. 

 The purpose of healing goes beyond securing physical improvement. Its aim is to bring into harmony your spirit, mind and body, so that you may lead a ful, healthy and happy life, and possess a deeper awareness of God's love. How long should you carry on with healing? Sometimes healing is successful in one treatment. Far more often, it is progressive; the results appear gradually. 

 Take time to browse- we hope you enjoy it all as much as we do. Also, check out the digital section for our on-line commissioned artwork. Commissioning: How We Live Casciani Evans Wood was commissioned by the Now Festival to interview the people of Nottingham. How We Live asks people about their experience of Nottingham and what their thoughts are on living and working in the city. The results of the interviews will appear as portraits and quotes at various venues around the city for the duration of the festival. 

 Have you checked your results (if strange results appeared) and written about this in your report? To answer "yes" to all of these questions, you need to show that: You have a sufficient range of data. This means that you have results for at least five different values of the thing you are investigating (i.e. five temperatures, five voltages etc.) You have taken repeat readings for each of these values. This allows you to spot anomalous readings (results that "stand out" as being wrong) and to check these if necessary. If odd results have appeared, you have checked them by repeating your experiment again.
