--dull appetite-- 

 Notes Joseph had been mercilessly thrown into a dried-up water pit by his own brothers, because they were jealous of him and his popularity with their father. We know that he pleaded with them for his life (Genesis 42 v 21) and that his distress and horror were so memorable that the brothers were still referring to it years later. It must have been heart-rending stuff - after all, Joseph faced a slow and painful death by starvation or drowning, and he was doubtless sobbing and crying out for mercy and rescue persistently. And yet we read that the brothers sat down to eat, apparently completely untouched and unmoved by his cries and pleas! Nothing in their consciences dulled their appetite it seems! 

 In his original sleevenote, producer Norman Schwartz describes working with the maestro; "I held my breath on this one... Michel went beyond the usual. His new inventions, voicings, harmonies and technical requirements for the players were at times outrageous. Lines that were at first glance unplayable were in actual fact perfectly written. Some players were temporarily speechless but in the end, because they are the best, it all worked out as Michel conceived it". Despite being overwhelmed with honours, music awards and Oscars, Michel Legrand has never let fame go to his head or dull his creative appetite. 

 Yes, unrestricted submarine warfare by the German Navy would be scrupulously examined. No, the obliteration of German cities by the Allied air forces was not relevant. 'Crimes against Humanity' would be treated in the same way. The mass killing of subject races by the Germans would come under the microscope, but not the Katyn massacre or the dropping of the Atomic Bomb on Japan. But you would be wrong if you thought that the obvious double-standards of the original trials had dulled the appetite of people for these one-sided charades. 

 Don't wait until you're sipping sangria by the pool to do something about it, prepare to look good now. Slim down It's easy to put on weight in the winter - who wants to eat salad when it's snowing outside? Hot comfort food, puddings, snacks in front of the TV all pile up while exercise and the gym on cold, dark nights have as much appeal as sticking your finger in your eye. Happily, the mind shift that seems to accompany summer means salads are once again on the menu as we opt for lighter foods and less of them. Heat has a great way of dulling your appetite and a cool drink, fruit and salad will often suffice where before only a three-course meal would do. 

 Fishing is only a part of the dayly activities, but having fun and relaxing should rule the day. Of course, you'll take your regular selection of fishing gear, but now that the water is warm, a mid-day swim provides a refreshing break that wasn't possible during the cold-water season of ice-out trolling for salmon and togue. Take your mask, fins, and snorkel so you can swim with the fish and see what they are doing; You will locate some new hotspots this way, especially for bass. And if the summer heat has dulled your appetite for lunch, the swim is guaranteed to bring it back. 

 That smells a bit fruity... 10.00: Stroll slowly through Little India, which is the spiciest part of Singapore - in the aromatic sense. The smells can be inhaled along Serangoon Road, and the cobbled alleyways off it. There, tiny shops are packed with everything from the latest in hi-tech equipment to carpets and cosmetics - much easier on the nostrils than the seasonal whiff of durians, a fruit which is rapturously acclaimed by local people but banned in offices and other enclosed spaces. Coffee and curry to go 11.45: A coffee and a curry puff from a street vendor won't dull the appetite for a light lunch at the famed Komala Vilas, 76/78 Serangoon Rod, (0065 6293 6980 komalavilas.com.sg). 

 By following the example of the psalmist's prayer, you can learn to rightly respond to God's Word: The supreme prayer the psalmist breathed is a confession of his inadequacy and God's sufficiency. The psalmist passionately desired to obey God's Word. The psalmist asked for help to turn from vain activities and to desire things of greatest value, including God's Word. We trust you'll derive life-long benefit from this golden alphabet of praise for the Word of God. But should sin seek to dull your appetite to read the Word, be sure to join your voice with the psalmist in the prayer he offered in the last stanza of Psalm 119: Let my cry come before You, O LORD; give me understanding according to Your word. 

 One of marijuana's better known side effects---as an appetite booster---has increased the pressure to legalise the drug for medical use. Many AIDS patients battling the deadly wasting that can be caused by the disease smoke marijuana to stimulate their appetites. This has made the drug a cause celebre for America's powerful and well-organised AIDS activists. There is a clear consensus that marijuana has a positive effect on appetite," says Richard Mattes, professor of nutrition at Purdue University in Indiana. But it is uncertain whether a healthier appetite actually leads to weight gain: after a sudden increase in food intake, the body may simply compensate by dulling the appetite when the drug's effects wear off. 

 Then in 1993, TNB recorded 'Die Stunde X,' a further experiment into the liberating potentials of feedback and harsh grinding; and if you've made it this far, O brave listener, you'll find you're so familiar with this stuff, you can almost whistle along to what they're doing. 4th CD is a 'celebration' of their twenty year career, with new recordings realised in 2002. 'Crincum-Crancum' is, relatively speaking, a near-musical concoction created (I guess, wildly) by switching between tracks at the mixing desk: we jump from whirrs to banging to feedback, and more besides, the elements almost conspiring to build a strange mixed chord shape (although no Rosedale chord organ from Woolworths could perform like this!) Perhaps twenty years hath mellowed the saturnine Rupenus' psyche and dulled their appetite for relentless noise; this is less urgent, and there's almost an air of resigned weariness to this 2002 work. 

 'I train who I want to,' he says. A personal recommendation is best when you are looking for a trainer, but try your local gym, health club or leisure centre and do ask about qualifications.

 Hi lot's of people ask me about weight loss . I want to answer once for everyone In the context of physical health, weight loss is the process of losing body weight, typically by losing fat.

For healthy weight loss, most experts recommend a combination of healthy eating patterns and regular physical exercise. Other methods of losing weight include use of prescribed or herbal drugs or chemicals that decrease appetite and/or increase physical activity. 

 A trial from South Africa found that avoidance of meat anddairy, and not the presence of fibre, appears to be primarily responsible for a low risk of colon cancer. As a result of these negative findings some researchers and doctors have begun to question the idea that insoluble fibre protects against colon cancer, a concept that had arisen from a large body of older research. Fibre also fills the stomach, reducing appetite. In theory, fibre should therefore reduce eating, leading to weight loss . However, at least some research has found increased fibre to have no effect on body weight despite decreasing appetite.

 Cautionary note for the reader: 'Crystal meth', the drug at the heart of the movie, is one of the nicknames for 'methamphetamine'. It is a very powerful nervous system stimulant which can be readily synthesised in small labs from cheap, over the counter chemicals. It is known by many names including 'speed', 'ice', 'glass', 'meth' and 'crank'. The drug can be snorted, smoked, injected or swallowed.
