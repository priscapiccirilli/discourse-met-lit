LFCSnumber8 posted a series of posts on the official site forum and has kindly agreed to them being posted on Liverweb Tom Saunders Yet another one of Liverpool's many brilliant 'bootroom boys', Tom Saunders was an invaluable assistant to every Liverpool manager from Shankly to Houllier with the exception of Kenny Dalglish. Born in Liverpool in 1921, Saunders was a boyhood Red. Although he never represented the club as a player or a manager, he filled most other roles. He served the club as director and scout, aswell as his excellent work in the bootroom. Saunders was originally a teacher, but his main passion was in football, and he coached the Liverpool Boys side from 1960 up until 1968. In 1968, he stopped juggling the jobs of headteacher and youth manager to join up with the Scot Bill Shankly at Anfield.

 She told me she had sacked the nanny after discovering she had been referring to her two year old as the "little bitch". The woman had also warned the agency she was totally unsuitable to work with young children. I immediately rang the agency who told me she'd 'slipped through the net' which frankly wasn't good enough. I was extremely angry, you don't expect to pay a hefty fee and then discover that a girl's references were never checked or verified. At the time I was pregnant and juggling a three-year-old and a job as a television producer for Channel 4. 

 Online consultation webpage . The online consultation will run from 15 February to 15 May 2006. Babies deliver lower pay and prospects From the moment they give birth, women get stuck on a 'mummy track' of low pay and low prospects as their wages fall and never fully recover - even when their children have left home, a new study has found. The effect continues when children start school, leading to another sudden slump in the average growth of women's pay compared with male wages, according to the report by the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Before they have children, the average hourly wage for female workers is 91 per cent of the male average but declines to 67 per cent for working mothers juggling jobs and childcare.

 Harlem was a cultural nucleus of the nation in the 1920s and early 1930s. Lawrence felt the persistence influence, the Harlem Renaissance had enveloped him within the artistic concentration thriving Harlem. He also found inspirations in his teachers, and in the people he met. Lawrence's mother, a single parent, tried to support her three children with domestic work but often end with welfare. While juggling odd jobs to help out, Lawrence committed himself to painting as a young teenager and had never change his commitment throughout his entire life. 

 But if you talk to any student on any campus in the UK they will be able to tell you about four or five people they know who are on the verge of having breakdowns, who are having breakdowns, who have eating disorders, who are so stressed they can't sleep, who don't talk to anybody. The levels of stress are very very high. Yet students have always found the transition from home to independence unsettling. So what has changed to trouble so many of them so severely? Experts point to the financial pressure to juggle part-time jobs and worry about debt since the replacement of grants by loans, and the surge in student numbers which means 18-year-olds may have to fend for themselves in private lodgings. 

 A friend had suggested she launch a Noelle Walsh newsletter based on the discount shopping idea. She went to work at the Daily Telegraph and worked like a trojan until 2am at night and every weekend for about six months on her Good Deal Directory plan. It was launched, in the form of a newsletter, at the Chelsea Flower Show in May 1992. We bravely had 80,000 newsletters printed and hired students to give them out. But it was incredibly hard going and, at the end of the five-day show, we had only got rid of 2,000! said Noelle. But the newsletters that had been handed out generated interest and Noelle found herself juggling enquiries alongside her job at the Telegraph. 

 I could never quite get my head around what it would be like until you actually have it and you don't have anyone that you can give it back to at the end of the day; it's your responsibility. That does change you fundamentally and you will never be as you were before. It's a whole different type of production, but it's certainly the most satisfying," she says. Motherhood has not yet made Sharrock consider leaving the theatre behind. In fact, though it's tough to juggle the two full-time jobs, the theatrical feeds off the familial through a whole new set of experiences.

She was run down and seemed to catch every bug going. Margaret had returned to her role as a sales manager for an IT company 5 months after Ben's birth and, although she was working part-time, she found the stress of juggling a demanding job and meeting deadlines with the demands of being a mum, overwhelming.

Bob Knight asks members to check their local libraries to see if they have canal mags in their reference section. If not, why? Alan Dyer has been Membership Secretary for a long time.

 That was not my experience in a ten-year stint of community living during the seventies. And now, twenty-five years later and with the benefit of hindsight I am still certain that it was not like that. Far from being escapists, the people I shared my life with at that time were at the coal-face of reality. There was idealism, of course, because without that there would have been no experiment in the first place. But there was also the day-to-day necessities of putting food on the table, of managing a job of work, of relating in the best way possible to the demands of the others one lived with. 

 All these factors are linked, creating a 'chain' which is difficult to break. Poverty is also strongly linked to being out of work, though those in work are often poorly paid too - half of all children living in poverty have a working parent. If you are disabled or from an ethnic minority community you will face prejudice and hostility that makes it even harder for you to make a decent living. If you are a woman you will often have additional responsibilities as a carer, making it harder for you to get and keep a job. You might have to manage several low-paid jobs, such as cleaning, telephone sales or checkout work, on top of looking after your family. 

 Steve Martin, Bonnie Haunt, Piper Perabo.

Tom has now to manage job and house-keeping to work and raise the children on his own, and the house is about to fall apart.

 We would suggest you talk to as many people as possible who are already in strategy consulting so that you are aware of how much time it would take to make the change, how it would affect your work hours, how it would affect your salary (would you have to start at a lower rung?), and preferably talk to mothers who work in this area. It's great that your husband is supportive as that will help with your confidence levels as well. However, you mention you have a full time place for your daughter as of October - are you sure you're ready to be away from her five days a week? You have already mentioned feelings of guilt at going back to work and this may exacerbate the situation. However, if you have got a good idea of how you will manage this with your job and have come to terms with this, then there is nothing to stop you enjoying your new career and your relationship with your daughter. 

 I say "we" in all this, because around 2,000 members, and countless volunteers, have been part of this roller-coaster ride. But at the helm throughout has been the Dons Trust Board. And the role the Board has played has not always been an easy one - analysing complex situations, taking tough decisions, representing members' views and interests. And doing plenty of the legwork too. Oh, and managing day-jobs and family lives as well.

 It requires a working relationship that is based upon trust and encourages employees to manage their own work. Computer links and mobile phones make keeping in touch and working away from the business far simpler. An increasing number of organisations see home working as an effective working option. Not all jobs will be suitable however, and organisations should consider: systems for supervision health and safety implications systems to monitor performance necessary equipment to do the job initial costs to set up running costs. Many home workers find they can manage their job and home more easily and give a better performance.
