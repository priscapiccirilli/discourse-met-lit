 General dental practitioners need to urgently carry out the advised dental treatment plan for these patients to avoid any delay of cancer treatment. If the preceding procedures have been completed, most patients will not need oral care during the course of their radiation therapy. However, continuing evaluation and supportive reinforcement is critical for these patients who will need to be seen in the Restorative Dentistry Oncology Clinic for dental evaluation and prosthodontic treatment if required, for management or amelioration and control of oral problems such as xerostomia, mucositis, opportunistic infection, nutritional difficulty. Radiation patients with head and neck cancer are at lifelong risk for oral disease as a result of their treatment. The possibility of tumour recurrence or persistence is significant, especially in those who continue to abuse alcohol. 

 In fact I pay the high prices to save a drunk thug causing a fight for the hell of it. mark from huddersfield : people are never happy. If new places opened and charged Â£4 a pint no one would go and there whould probably be a message board on over priced drinks. People know there limits just because asda are selling beans at 6p instead of 36p people dont go home and eat six cans. Make the most of it. Nothing lasts for ever. Wayne from Marsden now : I also think this is a non-issue. Students are uprooted, and have to make friends - how many casual conversations have been struck up in a Starbucks etc. If people want to abuse alcohol they will, price (and health) is no option - it is a drug. 

 Know your alcohol limits now you're expecting. Alcohol crosses the placenta to your baby very easily and quickly, and heavy drinking during pregnancy can damage your baby. Drinking too much will also damage your health. Women who abuse alcohol increase their risk of breast cancer and liver disease. 

 This was a population-based survey in nine US states with active surveillance to ensure as complete collection of data possible. In the years 1995-1998 there were 15,860 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease, in persons whose ages ranged from 0 to 104 years. The overall incidence was 23 per 100,000, with highest incidence in children under two years and adults over 65 years. About one in 10 cases resulted in death for all ages, and rose steadily from low rates in children to high rates in the over-80s. Higher case-fatality rates were also seen in persons with congestive heart failure, cancer, or who abused alcohol or had cirrhosis. 

 Shifty's New Leaflet Shifty's is still able to offer workshops in Alcohol Awareness. They have a fun approach to learning and will tailor a session to the age and needs of the young people you are working with. Dawn and Andy have designed a new leaflet, which should have been sent out with Chatterbox to all schools, colleges and youth groups to remind everyone that the alcohol awareness workshops are still available. The project has been funded for a further period by The Big Lottery and we are keen to see lots of young people taking part and understanding the dangers that abusing alcohol can bring. 

 No one could accuse Hugh Lee of not rising to a challenge. He left school with no qualifications, but is now studying for a PhD. And, despite a history of alcohol abuse and innumerable past injuries, he plans to run the world's highest marathon from Everest base camp, raising money for health charities in Nepal and closer to home in Harrogate. When Hugh left school at 16, he began to abuse alcohol, and was constantly in and out of hospital following drink-related accidents. 

 It takes less of it for women to feel the effects, although it does not always feel so because, with regular drinking, tolerance to alcohol can increase - meaning that you may need to have more alcohol to achieve the same effects as previously. Women who have professional careers are twice as likely to double the recommended level of alcohol intake. There seems to be a correlation between greater stress and consuming alcohol. Mothers are finding themselves having to compromise between being an 'at home' mother or juggling both career and child rearing. Women between 18-24 are particularly likely to abuse alcohol. 

 These forms of counselling aim to establish a caring, supportive relationship between client and counsellor, and within this to explore your past experiences and current life. The aim is to help you to see how the past is affecting your life now, and to enable you to make changes. Exploring Thought Patterns - Cognitive Therapy: This approach emphasises that the way we think influences how we feel. By helping you to recognise negative thought patterns which you may have developed without realising it, the aim is to help you to develop more positive attitudes. Behaviour Therapy: The aim of this approach is to change unhelpful ways of behaving that you may have developed, for example avoiding crowds through fear, or abusing alcohol. 

 He considers the question of attachment within the wider scale of the family dynamic. In order to do that, he very properly saw all the relevant family members, including the maternal grandparents and the mother's two children by a former partner, who happens to be the father's brother, and the result of that assessment is very clear. I will not cite substantial extracts from it, because it will plainly be before the judge when the judge hears the evidence of Dr Bentovim, and the judge will have to make up his mind about it. What Dr Bentovim was essentially saying was that this child had had a very unsettled first year of life because of what was on any view undoubtedly a very volatile relationship between his parents; both parents abusing cannabis, the father in particular abusing alcohol, regular arguments between them and occasional violence. 

 Study links genetic trait to addiction The St. Petersburg Times reports that in the hunt for the powerful forces that drive addictions, researchers say they have definitively linked a common genetic trait to drug and alcohol abuse. The discovery, which elaborates on earlier suspicions about a gene called mu-opioid, eventually may help people measure their own risk for addiction, and help scientists design more effective drugs for treating substance abuse. The study is published in this month's issue of Molecular Psychiatry . In it, scientists at the University of South Florida and James A. Haley VA Medical Center in Tampa report that 95% of study participants who abused alcohol, smoked and used illicit drugs shared a specific variation of the mu-opioid gene.

 Why did the researchers look at the link between alcohol and gout? It has always been believed that drinking alcohol raises the risk of developing gout, but no large-scale study had ever been conducted to prove or disprove the theory. This study is the first large-scale investigation of such a link and proves that alcohol does play role. How is alcohol thought to increase the risk of gout? Gout is due to the deposit of uric acid in the joints and drinking alcohol can increase the levels of uric acid in the body. 

 Timothy 5:17 in the RSV Bible tells us that God "richly furnishes us with everything to enjoy". It would appear that He approves of pleasure. This makes perfect sense considering that it was He who designed us with the capacity to enjoy pleasure in the first place. This sometimes seems to have been lost on certain self-appointed guardians of evangelical morality. These are the people who will tell you things not specifically prohibited in the Scriptures ought to be. Three examples might be the practices of smoking, drinking alcohol and dancing. 

 There's no fizz, it's the cloudy stuff, it's all natural, it's very potent. I like Harvester or Taunton Dry. If the pub hasn't got the cider that I want I won't drink the other commercial stuff. Other than that I'll just drink lager like anyone else. I didn't become a rugby player touring the world by not drinking alcohol in all its guises. 

 This unexpected discovery is the outcome of a study into how group processes combine with alcohol consumption to affect risk attraction among young people. The results of the study, which was conducted by Professor Dominic Abrams, Tim Hopthrow, Lorne Hulbert and Daniel Frings at the University of Kent, indicate that with moderate social drinking groups may provide an informal means of mutual regulation and monitoring that can offset some aspects of 'alcohol myopia'. Professor Abrams explained: Until now, research on the effects of alcohol has focused largely on individuals. For example, as a result of drinking alcohol, individuals are more likely to be sexually irresponsible, aggressive or emotional.

 One drink was 12 grams of alcohol in the USA and Italy, 8 grams in the UK and 10 grams elsewhere. Results The average age at diagnosis of breast cancer was 52 years. Women with higher alcohol consumption also tended to smoke more in cases and controls. Only 37% of women who never drank alcohol had ever smoked, a proportion rising to about 70% in those with the highest alcohol intake. In women who had never drunk alcohol (22,000 cases and 41,000 controls) there was no relationship between breast cancer and smoking history (relative risk 1.03). Because of the relationship between increased alcohol consumption and increased smoking, no reliable information could be drawn for smokers who also drank alcohol. 

 These groups of people may have a diet that is not meeting their nutritional requirements and may benefit from vitamin supplements: Elderly people, particularly those who live on their own, may find it harder to make healthy meals, and may wish to top up their vitamin intake with a multivitamin supplement. Older people who don't get much sun because they are housebound or covered up for most of the year are advised to take a supplement that includes ten micrograms of vitamin D each day. Vegetarians and vegans - consider taking vitamin supplements to replace those that are found in meat and dairy products, particularly if it's not possible to substitute meat with high-protein foods such as pulses and beans. People who are chronically ill. People who drink alcohol heavily. 

 She had also discovered that the opposite, 'pulling water' running from the head to the feet, can cause dizziness, blackouts, loss of balance and fainting(2). A recent survey by Christopher McNaney of the People's Research Centre, Alston, has revealed that gypsies and travelling people have a surprisingly low level of illness. When asked about incidences of cancer in their relatives, he found that it is less than 1%, against 25-33% mortality in the rest of the population. Heart disease and other serious illnesses so prevalent in our society are also very low. Their general lifestyle can hardly be attributed to their well-being, as they smoke, drink alcohol and ignore health foods and special diets. 

 Can be obtained from the Department of Health, Richmond House, 79 Whitehall, London SW1A 2NS. Editor's Note NTORS is a document worth getting and reading in total. The study: In 1995 the study recruited over 1000 clients from four different treatment modalities:- inpatient units, residential rehabs and community-based methadone reduction programmes and methadone maintenance programmes cited over England. Heroin was the commonest drug used (87%), nearly two-thirds were injecting and over a third were using crack-cocaine. A quarter of the injectors were sharing equipment; more than two-thirds were drinking alcohol at worrying high levels. 

 It is, however, possible to try and work out the NNT for beneficial effects of alcohol consumption. A Danish study in the BMJ [1] examined the relationships between alcohol consumption and high and low density lipoprotein at the start of observations, with ischaemic heart disease incidence over the following six years as the outcome measure. The study population was 2,826 men aged 53-74 years. There are many interesting results, especially the high protective effect of alcohol in men with high LDL cholesterol drinking more than 22 drinks a week. The most important result was the overall conclusion that drinking alcohol prevents ischaemic heart disease.
