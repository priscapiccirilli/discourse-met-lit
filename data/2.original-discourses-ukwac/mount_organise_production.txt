 Peter Shaffer is one of the most successful playwrights now writing, and it is perhaps his mainstream box office success that has caused his work to be so scantily treated by critics. In 1973 Peter Shaffer wrote Equus, which opened at the National Theatre and quickly attracted popular acclaim. Within a year it was moved to Broadway where it ran for over a thousand performances, winning the Tony Award and the Drama Critics Award for best play. In 1974 Sir Anthony Hopkins' acting career was launched in the USA making his debut in Equus playing Dr. Martin Dysart winning the New York Drama Desk Award and the Outer Critics' Circle Award for best actor. He later mounted another production of the play in Los Angeles, where he received the Los Angeles Drama Critics' Award. 

 Dr Jennifer Wallace, who has published books on Shelley and Keats and also on the cultural significance of food, teaches eighteenth and nineteenth century literature and also the compulsory third year paper on Tragedy. Mr Christopher Tilmouth (Research Fellow) is completing a doctorate dissertation on the "Idea of the Passions in the 17th Century and he assists with the teaching of Renaissance Literature in the College. Peterhouse English has a proud history of involvement with the theatre. It numbers the theatre directors Richard Eyre and Sam Mendes among its alumni and has seen many of its recent students go off for careers in acting or stand-up comedy. The college drama society, the Heywood Society, mounts theatre productions each year while Peterhouse students also enjoy an unusually high profile in wider university drama societies. 

 Beamish's brother Oliver is a professional, who will be appearing in Sweeney Todd at the Theatre Royal the week after Beamish's musical hits the boards in Gartmore. Family gatherings in the Beamish household featured domestic concerts with young Sally, a more than capable pianist, as accompanist. (There's a touch of the von Trapps in the musical lineage of the Beamish family.) Beamish's decision to write a musical followed last year's show by the village company. The Forest Theatre Company mounted a production of The Sound of Music, in which Beamish played a nun, and in which her 10-year-old daughter Stephanie also appeared. 

 There is a full and varied programme arranged with readings of plays and auditions which take place to decide our future productions. We produce three plays a year, ranging from Classic Theatre to Comedies, with an occasional Revue and a Pantomime produced every other year. If you are interested in joining, or would like to be added to The Manor Players mailing list, why not contact our secretary: Liz Cheetham on 01932 782400. Or just come along to one of our meetings. Riverside Youth Theatre is a community based youth theatre for 12-18 year olds. We mount two major productions a year in December and May - productions which range from Musicals, One Act Plays, Revues to Shakespeare. 

 The new community The Hornsey Road site is not far from our old home and again we shall be occupying buildings that are part of the history of Islington. We are looking forward to not only welcoming all our old friends to the new theatre but also becoming part of the local community. From the contacts we have made, there is every indication that we shall be very welcome. Life on the Road The company moved out of its Canonbury home in March 2003. Since then we have mounted numerous productions in venues all over North London, and have continued to tour to Paris, the Minack Theatre in Cornwall and to a new venue in Swanage. 

 Founding members Alice Garner and Kate Atkinson wanted to use the collective might of Australian actors to influence community attitudes toward refugees and asylum seekers and to encourage a humanitarian response to their plight. Almost five years on, they now have a large support base and a strong presence in refugee advocacy, with involvement in broad activities such as campaigns, lobbying and public speaking, as well as performing their two shows 'Something to Declare' and 'Club Refuge' to audiences across Australia. These performances are rehearsed readings of true stories and first hand testimonies of asylum seekers and refugees in Australia. They have networks in other states, and will be active in mounting productions nationally. 

 An auditorium will shared by the Lyric Opera and the State Ballet, plus, glory be, a separate facility all its own for the company, school and administration. Bolender commenced The State Ballet as a cross state venture, playing a three season programs in both Kansas City and St. Louis. He started with a nucleus of a dozen dancers, and the company roster has grown to twenty-two with three adult and four student apprentices. The name State Ballet of Missouri itself dates from 1986. In its eighteen year existence, the company has mounted 79 productions, the number factoring out to four plus new productions a season, which comprises three repertory programs and the ballet world's cash cow, "The Nutcracker", at Christmastime. 

 We have a new sound system and a new lighting rig. We have new radio microphones, new speakers, new digital technology, a new lighting board, new curtains, new staging blocks and even a new smoke machine!! We are using them all.... Despite the wonderful new technology, however, Kinetic Theatre will not lose sight of its principle aims. We try to provide an opportunity for students to experience the highs and lows of mounting a full-scale production. 

 In the world of Sixth Form extra-curricular activities, there is genuinely something for everyone and no excuse for boredom! Music, drama, dance and a wide range of sports are particularly popular. Radio 6 In Sixth Form we encourage students to start their own clubs and societies and run them themselves. Recently students have established a 'Radio 6' station which broadcasts to the rest of the school at break-time, with S6 interviews, DJs and music. In the past, Sixth Formers have produced and written their own plays and, in 2006, mounted their own production of 'The Sound of Music', directed, acted, performed and danced by the students themselves! 

 This programme aims to prepare students for entry into the performing arts/theatre profession, providing students with the skills necessary to create their own employment. Active research is also encouraged. The course brings live performance to surrounding areas of the community and students have actively liaised with employers in the past: booking a variety of local venues for their work. Students are also encouraged to mount their own productions and performance evenings, participate in additional workshops such as technical theatre or journalism and produce their own showcase evenings.

 She has published two books on Romantic topics: Shelley and Greece: Rethinking Romantic Hellenism (Macmillan, 1997) and Lives of the Great Romantics: Keats (Pickering and Chatto, 1997). Dr Wallace's other main research interest is in the classical tradition and in our continuing fascination with Greece, ancient and modern. She has published articles on Greek tragedy, on the hellenism of Matthew Arnold and on the imaginative power of Illyria, and she is continuing a study of the excavation of Troy. She is also preparing a book on women and the classics, and has written essays on two bluestocking writers, Elizabeth Carter and Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Each year, she takes groups of Peterhouse students, studying the Tragedy paper with her, to productions of Greek tragedy in London or Stratford and, as joint secretary of the Cambridge University Greek Play Committee, which organises the triennial production of a Greek Tragedy in Greek (a tradition which goes back to 1882), she takes a lively interest in contemporary performance of Greek drama. 

 Each year I attend a musical production put on by Bedford Modern School, I come away saying "They will never beat this one!  - and each year I am proved wrong! This year it was "My Fair Lady" and it was a triumph! Nick Brooks, as Professor Higgins, and Matt Burt, as Colonel Pickering, were superb in their roles, both quite demanding ones, as they are on stage for much of the two and a half hour production. Elie Middleton, as Eliza Doolittle excelled, as did Doug Penman as Alfred Doolittle. How Helen Rees-Bidder (director) and John Mower (Musical director) manage to organise productions like this, and still have a full time-table, amazes those who are lucky enough to get tickets for such performances. 

 In the last five years, the GCSE pass rate in his classes has increased from 64% to 94%, a substantial achievement in itself. Anna has been teaching at St Joseph's Catholic Primary School in Stourbridge for two years, having finished her three year QTS Advanced Early Years degree in 2000. The judges from the Teacher of the Year Awards were struck by her enthusiasm and teaching skills. Faced with some challenging pupils in her class, Anna was able to help them overcome emotional and learning difficulties, improving the class as a whole. She is also heavily involved in extra curricular activities, from running the netball team to organising school productions. 

 I typed this message BEFORE reading your second posting. I will reply to your latest questions in the message that I intend to post tomorrow. During the early days of running your venture, it might be necessary for one or more (or all) of you to do some other regular work (i.e. have a job, maybe part-time) in order to earn enough money for you to live on. You should ensure that you have sufficient understanding of BASIC ACCOUNTING. It will probably be best for you to launch your venture in a SMALL place and focus simply on the idea of providing a centre where young people can meet regularly in order to organise production, projects and events (e.g. exhibitions) in the local community. 

 While the Kazan-Brando film looks backward to the thirties in its working class locale, the Ray-Dean film is more characteristic of the new emphasis of Hollywood on the problems that affluence was bringing the middle classes. The film as a commentary on its times Hollywood's new responsibilities in the war years led some to look forward to less escapist, more adult American movies. Certainly the socially conscious writers and directors who came to the film capital from the East hoped for a more decentralised process of film-making as the old authoritarian studios lost their power. Except for the most successful directors, and for a number of B pictures, such hopes were generally unrealised. Yet On the Waterfront did set a standard for a more co-operative film-making tradition based in New York; Sam Spiegel strictly organised the production but the circumstances allowed the creative personnel more autonomy than was normal under studio supervision. 

 Material or other subject matter that is developed in the University of which the copyright is owned by the University, including any that may fall under Regulation 8, may be released under Open Source or similar arrangements on the authority of the Head of Department in which the material is created. The Head of Department may delegate such authority within a Department without restriction. (When material is derived from material acquired under Open Source arrangements that require any distribution of derived material to be under the same arrangements, no authority to distribute need be sought.) The law accords rights against exploitation of certain products by third parties to creators who organize their production; these include sound recordings, films, broadcasts, published works (in respect of their typographical arrangement) and databases (in respect of extraction and utilization of their content). 

 The department is committed to the integration of theory and practice at all times. No members of staff consider themselves to be academics rather than practitioners or vice versa. All courses are taught by drama specialists. The emphasis of the teaching is upon experimental projects that test ideas rather than glamorous but orthodox productions. An active 'student workshop' which organises theatre productions, social events and guest visits from theatre professionals, and the College Drama Society offer ample opportunity for students to develop their own theatre practice outside the curriculum. 

 Artistic activities flourish and there is a successful arts week each year. Music is well catered for, with a strong instrumental, choral and jazz tradition. The Music Society puts on concerts regularly. The mixed chapel choir, made up of choral scholars and volunteers, sings regularly in chapel services and also tours both in the UK and Europe. There are opportunities to write for college publications, and the Drama Society organises productions every term and welcomes new actors, playwrights and stage-hands. 

 I have lived in the Caversham area for most of my life and I currently live in Emmer Green with my husband and daughter. Having graduated from Cardiff University in Music and Education I trained as a Primary School teacher and spent 4 years working as a class teacher with responsibility for Music across the school, and 5 years as a music specialist teaching music to children aged 4 to 11. My teaching roles included leading choirs, teaching recorders, and organising musical productions. 

It is the money that they can choose how they wish to spend. Economic rent Economic rent is the difference between what a factor of production is earning (its return) and what it would need to be earning to keep it in its present use. It is in other words the amount a factor is earning over and above what it could be earning in its next best alternative use (its transfer earnings). Economies of scale Economies of scale occur when larger firms are able to lower their unit costs. This may happen for a variety of reasons. A larger firm may be able to buy in bulk, it may be able to organise production more efficiently, it may be able to raise capital cheaper and more efficiently.
