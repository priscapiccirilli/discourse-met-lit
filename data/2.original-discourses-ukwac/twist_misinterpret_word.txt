--twist word-- 

 As a neutral observer I recently attended the Public Inquiry on the proposed bus route (CDTS). In this newspaper , Audrey Hodgkinson recently paid tribute to the Anti-CDTS group's excellent speakers. One speaker said during the inquiry that Cheshire County Council's QC made flippant remarks. This is an understatement. I was horrified to watch the council's barrister berate, intimidate and at times try to humiliate the objectors. He twisted their every word, almost treating them like criminals in the dock. 

This is why Muslims consider it offensive for US prison guards to flush the Koran down the toilet, or witnesses in US courtrooms swear w ith their hand on the Bible. I don't think anyone would swear an oath with their hand on a copy of Adam Smith..... I also want to point out I never questioned the validity of studying texts, but it is important that we are able to measure the truth of the text against some other physical standard - at least in the scientific setting we were originally discussing. Quote: would question whether religion is outside normal human experience. In world history the vast majority of people have experienced religion! Smart, but you are twisting my words as you well know.

 You can witness to lost souls in USENET newsgroups (such as alt.atheism and talk.origins ), or in message fora on their websites. Self contradiction In a heated argument, you will often find yourself losing track of your previous posts, and the atheist will often accuse you of contradicting comments you made earlier. As your words are Bible-based, it stands to reason that they should therefore be correct at all times. Refer to " 1 Inerrancy ". Alternatively, remember that, as slaves of The Evil One, atheists will do their best to twist your words and attempt to confuse you. 

 Naturally, they object if you point this out to them, so you must do your best to express your point of view in clear and simple terms. If they do not understand, be prepared to explain in more detail. Avoid saying "It just is , okay! (see later). This is more likely to come from the theist. You don't have to use a cop-out if you are losing the argument (which is rare :), but the theist almost certainly will. Watch out for :- "God works in a mysterious way" "We are not meant to question His actions" "We are not meant to have that knowledge" "Don't try to twist my words!" 

 would it really be better the other way round ? Yes, because it would be to men's advantage, not disadvantage. I also added that I have fallen foul of these laws myself So? Clear now Crystal. Yes, because it would be to men's advantage, not disadvantage. That is the answer to the question I posed. I was just trying to work out where TF it is you are coming from. I was not twisting your words, merely expressing a different opinion. 

 Or there's the Band, who had their fair share of Dylan as supplementary member and songwriter- how do I explain the fondness I have for their first two albums and the Basement Tapes ? Partly the Felt song 'Ballad of the Band', partly seeing Robbie Robertson dressed as a ringer for de Niro's young rascal Johnny Boy from Mean Streets in the Scorsese concert film The Last Waltz . Their well-worn 'I Shall be Released' is covered by P. J. Proby in winning style on his Believe It or Not! The way he twists the words, elongates syllables, makes you think about them anew, to the point where his excess leads you into different directions from any Mr. Zimmermann might have envisaged 

 O'Brien was still in bed next morning when the police called. There were three cars and 10 officers. They surrounded the house and smashed the door down with a sledgehammer. At the police station, O'Brien was refused a solicitor. 'They were shouting and screaming at me. They lied to get me confused and twisted my words to try to get me to admit to things I hadn't said. 

 He has also taken advantage of my learning disabilities and called me a liar when I tell people thing about what he has said etc. My job is to stack shelves but because I have learning disabilities I cant read the labels properly and so do my work from memory. I may work slower than everyone else because it does get hard to remember where over 300 things are meant to go. I do ask for help when I need it and this has never been a problem. I need to sort this out because he is making my working life a misery. He shows me no respect, twists my words when I complain about him and I never have anyone to witness what he is doing. 

 The fact that you value the life of a cockroach over the life of an infant or a Grandparent shows where your "karmic" values lie. They will catch up to you in the next life.'nuff said. I will not comment on this further...... I never once said I value any life over another. So I was correct when I said you'd twist my words for them to mean whatever you want them to mean. 

 And the rest of it, I was crying out of pity for his jumped up, flippant, oblivious attitude of living his life and letting other people pick up the pieces or bail him out. I even said, "We're two entirely different people and you wouldn't understand what was wrong with you even if I laid it down for you. I told and he listened and I told him to be careful otherwise he would get hurt or something would happen. I only hope that it got through to him. I mean, however much he's slagged me off, and twisted my words and belitttled me in the past, I have never cried in front of him. 

 --misinterpret word-- 

 Now you will indeed hate me," I said. It is useless to attempt to conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you. A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on the truth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm. I knew the steely ire I had whetted. I was heart-wrung. You utterly misinterpret my words," I said, at once seizing his hand: "I have no intention to grieve or pain you -- indeed, I have not. 

 Indeed Mr Barker says that he consulted with a lawyer involved in his other current activities in the MPS and that the lawyer told him that the Review might indeed be disclosable. Incidentally the AMIP guidelines confirm that this is so when in paragraph 8.8 they indicate that "The report should be regarded as pertinent to the inquiry and may be the subject of debate in a court. It should therefore be filed with the case papers". It is apparent therefore that Mr Barker embarked on this Review with two inhibiting fetters imposed effectively by himself. First, in our opinion, he misinterpreted the words spoken to him by Mr Blenkin insofar as he believed that he should not undermine the confidence of the team and particularly the SIO. 

 Would have thought that was blindingly obvious, but hey, try this for size. PADI notices a massive increase in medical incidents directly related to a skill and stop said skill. Are you honestly telling me that the UKSDMC would ignore it and wait till one of the agencies in there remit had similar problems? Or maybe they (like us) see ALL agency info as good imput and make decisions accordingly. I think its incredably naive to suggest that what other agencies do have no bearing whatsover. See... you've changed the subject again! ...and tried to misinterpret my words again! 

 Failure to master the basic laws of leverage, body position, balance, footwork, and so forth is what Bruce termed "having no form". In other words, ignorance. No-form", on the other hand, is that level of executing techniques to such perfection that doing so no longer requires thought. (As in the quote from Enter The Dragon..."when there is an opening, I do not hit, it hits all by itself"). JKD is both a philosophy AND a system that Bruce continued to refine until his untimely death. Over the years, some have misinterpreted Bruce's words regarding personal expression to mean "anything goes"-that by taking a little bit of this and a little of that from many different arts, they are then practicing JKD. 

 How good are your communication skills? Do you always get what you want? Are you never misunderstood? Well, congratulations -- you don't need this book! However, if, like most of us, you're often frustrated by people not taking notice of what you have to say or misinterpreting your words or actions, then read on. 

 Second, I was deeply distressed by Craig's failure to grasp that, by including Irving in the conversation, he was according these "obtuse and quickly discredited" views a new found prominence and credibility. I worried, however, that if someone such as this highly respected scholar, who knew so much about the period, could be beguiled by Irving, how much easier it would be to beguile a jury of ten [ sic. twelve ] British citizens or even a British judge. Though he hoped Irving would drop the threat of a lawsuit, Julius counseled that we must proceed as if we would end up in court. When I asked Julius how we were going to fight this, he explained that there were a number of different options open to libel defendants. They could argue that the plaintiff was misinterpreting the words in question. 

 We intend to use corrective feedback by allowing the speaker of a language game to provide the hearer with the correct reference of an expression if the language game was unsuccessful, e.g., by means of pointing at the intended target. It is unclear to what extent children receive corrective feedback on erronous use of word-meaning mappings. However, it is clear that like in adult-adult communication ( Clark 1996 ), participants of adult-child communication carefully monit or the correctness of the language use ( Chouinard & Clark 2003 ). Chouinard & Clark have argued that, although, children may not be corrected by providing them with the correct meaning of a word, they are provided with the correct word for a certain meaning. Furthermore, we believe that children are well capable of evaluating the effectiveness of a language game, and alter their hypotheses about a word's meaning when they misinterpret a word. 

 I must learn what is at the bottom of it all. If you do not know, cannot guess, or are not at liberty to tell me, I shall take my hat and go back to my bank as came. "I do not know," answered the lawyer, "but I have an excellent guess. Your father, and no one else, is at the root of this apparently unnatural business. "My father! cried Francis, in extreme disdain. Worthy man, I know every thought of his mind, every penny of his fortune!  "You misinterpret my words," said the lawyer. 

 The use of nuclear weapons to achieve political ends is also alive and well. That became evident this past month when Russian President Boris Yeltsin said during a meeting at the Kremlin on 4 February that a US attack on Iraq could provoke a world war. One must be careful in a world that is saturated with all kinds of weapons," said Yeltsin. By his actions, Clinton might get into a world war. Yeltsin's spokesman attempted to explain the startling statement by blaming American journalists for misinterpreting his words, but the next day Yeltsin reiterated his remarks, adding that Russia "would not allow" a US military strike on Iraq. 

 Mr McConnell: I will make two points in response to that. First, the situation has little to do with whether the Scottish Executive has the legal authority to take a stake in Partnerships UK. The proposal that is before the Scottish Parliament this week is that it should do so. We are not asking whether individual Scottish public bodies wish to use the services of Partnerships UK—which will exist whether we have a stake in it or not. Secondly, it is important that we do not try to misinterpret words that are used carefully in the committee.
